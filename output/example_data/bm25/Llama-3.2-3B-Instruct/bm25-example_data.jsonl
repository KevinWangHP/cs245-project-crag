            "Microsoft Office 2019 (second release codenamed Office 16 ) is a version of Microsoft Office for both Windows and Mac. It replaces Office 2016 and was replaced by Office 2021 on October 5, 2021. [8] It was unveiled on April 27, 2018, for Windows 10 and June 12, 2018, for macOS , and launched on September 24, 2018. [1] Some features that had previously been restricted to Office 365 subscribers are available in this release. [9] Office 2019 retains the same major version number of 16 that Office 2016 had, making it the second perpetual release of Office 16. Microsoft ended mainstream support for Office 2019 on October 10, 2023. Unlike other versions of Microsoft Office, Office 2019 will only get two years of extended support, which means that support for Office 2019 will end on the same day as support for Office 2016 and Windows 10, on October 14, 2025. [10]",
            "Deployment [ edit ] Office 2019 requires Windows 10 , Windows Server 2019 or macOS Mojave and later. [10] macOS installations can be acquired from the Microsoft website or the Mac App Store . [21] For Office 2013 and 2016 , various editions containing the client apps were available in both Click-To-Run (inspired by Microsoft App-V ) and traditional Windows Installer setup formats. However, Office 2019 client apps only have a Click-to-Run installer and only the server apps have the traditional MSI installer. The Click-To-Run version has a smaller footprint; in case of Microsoft Office 2019 Pro Plus, the product requires 10 GB less than the MSI version of Office 2016 Pro Plus. [22] Volume licensing versions of Office 2019 cannot be downloaded from Microsoft Volume Licensing Service Center and must be deployed using configuration.xml and running Office Deployment Tool (ODT) from command-line. [23]",
            "Can I have multiple versions of Office on the same computer? Yes, though certain rules and limitations apply. For instance, you must first install the older version of office and then the newer one. All versions must either be 64bit or 32bit. You cannot mix the two. In some case, specifics steps must be followed (such as with Office 2010), as workarounds to known bugs.",
            "If you select OK instead of Default , the proofing language you chose will only apply to the current file. Normally, Word defaults to the language of the operating system.

            "Best Dow Jones ETF Investing in an ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) is another way to invest in the Dow Jones index. The best Dow Jones ETF in the market today is SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA) . It is a non-leveraged ETF that copies the performance of the Dow and its stock allocation. 5-Year Performance of SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust",
            "Dow Jones Industrial Average One of the oldest stock indexes, the Dow Jones tracks 30 of the largest U.S. companies. Finally, the Dow has been slower than other indexes to evolve with the fast growth of the technology sector . Although the Dow added Apple back in 2015, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms ( META -1.6% ),\u00a0and Nvidia ( NVDA 0.86% ), which have a combined market cap of around $4 trillion, are all absent from the index. The tech companies it does contain -- such as Intel and Cisco -- seem like dated legacy players, and both have performed poorly in recent years. Despite the criticism, the Dow is still a useful yardstick for measuring stock market performance, especially as many of its components are leading companies. Although it shouldn't be the only index you use to examine the stock market, understanding its strengths and weaknesses and what drives its movements will help you better assess the performance of the overall stock market.",
            "Have an excellent reputation Dow 30 Stocks List Description: The following table includes all of the current Dow 30 stocks. The Dow 30 list includes and can be sorted on: company name, market cap, dividend yield, stock price, stock price percent change (for the current trading day). For comparison purposes, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is included. Clicking on any row within the table will instantly update the chart (located on top of the table) for that stock. For more charts and data on any of the Dow 30 companies (e.g. trend chart, seasonality chart), click on a company name. Feel free to reload this page to get the latest stock quotes throughout the trading day. Keep in mind that the Dow 30 can change at any time by the powers that be at S&P Dow Jones Indices (for a list of Dow changes since 1929, try our Dow Deletions Table ). Don\u2019t miss out on important revisions to the Dow (and Dogs of the Dow). Get our free Dogs of the Dow Newsletter .",

            "According to S&P Global ( SPGI -0.74% ), which operates both the Dow Jones and the S&P 500, there are few specific requirements for Dow components. They must be members of the S&P 500 , which comes with its own set of requirements, including being based in the U.S. and being profitable at the time of admission. S&P Global has said that a stock is admitted to the Dow 30 \"only if the company has an excellent reputation, demonstrates sustained growth and is of interest to a large number of investors.\" The Dow index is price-weighted, meaning that each stock's impact on the index is determined by its share price. As a result, companies may be excluded based on a share price that is too high -- for example, in the $1,000 range -- or too low. The index managers also strive for a balance across sectors.",

            "Understanding the Dow Unlike the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, which are weighted by market cap , the Dow is a price-weighted index, so each stock has a greater influence on the index as its price goes up. For example, a 1% move in a stock trading at $200 a share would move the index twice as much as a 1% move in a stock priced at $100 a share. Each company's weight on the index is determined by the Dow Divisor, which is calculated by dividing the total price of all 30 Dow components by the value of the index. Currently, the Dow Divisor is 0.1492. \u00a0This figure can change frequently for events like stock splits \u00a0or when new companies are added to the index.",

            "What is Dow Jones 30 Index? Dow Jones is also known as The Dow , Dow 30 , and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). It consists of 30 massive companies in the US. It was created by Wall Street Journal editor Charles Dow and was named after him and his business partner, Edward Jones . DJ30 is the second oldest index in the United States.",

            "Learn about the stock market's old benchmark. By Jeremy Bowman \u2013 Updated Nov 20, 2023 at 10:09AM For many casual investors, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJINDICES:^DJI ) is the stock market. This index of 30 blue chip companies has been shorthand for the broad market since it was first published in 1896. Although there are better barometers for the performance of the overall stock market, even today the Dow tends to get first billing over other indexes such as the Nasdaq\u00a0 ( NASDAQINDEX:^IXIC ) and the S&P 500 ( SNPINDEX:^GSPC ) on newscasts and financial news websites. Image source: Getty Images.",
            "Shortcomings of the Dow There is no shortage of criticism for the Dow. Many investors believe its price-weighted nature makes it outdated and that there's no reason to use it now when market cap-weighted indexes like the S&P 500 give a better view of the stock market's performance and are readily available. Another issue with its price-weighted formulation is that high-priced stocks would never be permitted on the index even if they deserve to be members. Before their stocks split , stocks such as Alphabet\u00a0 ( GOOG -0.31% ) ( GOOGL -0.51% ) and\u00a0 Amazon ( AMZN -1.95% ), even though they are among the most valuable companies in the world, would have never been selected to join the Dow Jones Industrial Average. That's because they both traded for more than $2,000 per share, so they would've severely distorted the index if they were added to it.",
            "What companies are in the Dow? The Dow Jones Industrial Average has been made up of 30 companies since 1928, which is why it's also known as the Dow 30. Even though it's called the Dow Jones Industrial Average, distinguishing it from other Dow Jones indexes such as the Dow Jones Transportation Average, the word \"industrial\" is an anachronism. The index was once made up of industrial companies such as manufacturers and agricultural companies, but today it's a diverse snapshot of the stock market, containing representatives from nearly every major stock market sector , including technology, consumer goods, healthcare, and energy, as well as industrials. The only exceptions are transportation and utilities, which have their own Dow Jones indexes.",
            "The Dow evolved this way because in the days before the personal computer it was difficult to calculate a market cap-based index, but it was easy to do a price-weighted one. Although the Dow may not be as accurate as other indexes, its performance generally reflects that of the broad stock market. That shows that the diversification and size of its components make it a convenient way to track the overall stock market.",

            "History of the Dow The Dow Jones Industrial Average was created in 1896 by Charles Dow, who was an editor at\u00a0 The Wall Street Journal , and his business partner, Edward Jones. Before that, they published their first index in 1885, which consisted of 12 railroads and two industrial companies. Those would evolve into the Dow Jones Transportation Average and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, respectively.\u00a0 When the Dow was launched in 1896, it tracked 12 industrial companies, including General Electric ( GE -1.96% ), which was a Dow component until recently, and a number of companies that no longer exist such as American Tobacco, American Sugar, and Chicago Gas. In 1916, the index expanded from 12 components to 20, and, in 1928, it grew to hold 30 companies, just as it does today.\u00a0 In 1932, the index began to reflect the broader market rather than just industrial stocks, listing companies such as Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble, which are still part of the index today.",

        "question": "what is the other language between heaven and hell came out in originally?",
        "query_time": "03/19/2024, 23:28:32 PT",
        "page_contents": [
            "EHRMAN: (Laughter) I know, exactly. This is the big surprise of the book, and it's the one thing people probably wouldn't expect because, you know, when I was growing up, I just assumed. This is the view of Christianity. So this must be what Jesus taught. This is what the Old Testament taught. And in fact, it's not right. Our view that you die and your soul goes to heaven or hell is not found anywhere in the Old Testament, and it's not what Jesus preached. I have to show that in my book, and I lay it out and explain why it's absolutely not the case that Jesus believed you died and your soul went to heaven or hell. Jesus had a completely different understanding that people today don't have. GROSS: Are there things in the Hebrew Bible that still support the idea of heaven and hell as people came to understand it, things that you can extract from the Old Testament that might not literally mention heaven and hell but still support the vision that emerged of it?",
            "Heaven Originally the term \"heaven\" referred to the sky or the area above the earth where the \"heavenly bodies\" are placed. This is the main meaning of the word in the Bible . It was considered the dwelling place of God and his angels . However, with time, the term came to be used also in the sense of the abode of the righteous at some point after death. This is supported by a few verses in the Bible, but the Bible tends to use other terms, such as Paradise , for this. (See below for other terms.)",
            "It's not an accident that that came into Christianity after the majority of people coming into the Christian church were raised in Greek circles rather than in Jewish circles because in Jewish circles, there is no separation of the soul and the body. The soul didn't exist separately. But in Greek circles, going way back to Plato and before him, that was absolutely the belief. The soul was immortal and would live forever in Greek thinking. And so these people who converted to Christianity were principally Greek thinkers, they thought there was a soul that live forever. They developed the idea, then, that the soul lived forever with God when it's rewarded. GROSS: So you were saying there really isn't an explicit description of heaven and hell in the Hebrew Bible or even in the New Testament, but that Paul is important in understanding the history of heaven and hell. Tell us about what Paul wrote.",
            "It\u2019s helpful to have that in our minds as we encounter passages that deal with heaven such as John\u2019s famous description: \u201cThe great street of the city was of pure gold, like transparent glass\u201d (Revelation 21:21). The streets are made of gold, but not gold as we know it. Gold is not see-through; otherwise, celebrities would be wearing it. John saw something familiar (gold) but different. As the template of continuity/discontinuity can keep us from overspiritualizing heaven, so we also want to be aware that Scripture uses symbolic language to describe the new heavens and new earth \u2013 language meant to convey concepts, not actual geography. Symbolism is shorthand for reality. When you see a symbol for a women\u2019s room, you know what it means, but women don\u2019t look like that graphic, do they?",
            "You've also studied the Gnostic Gospels, which were the recently discovered gospels that never became part of the canon. And these are more mystical texts. And the most famous of the Gnostic Gospels is Thomas. What was his vision of what happens after death? EHRMAN: The various groups of Christians that people sometimes label gnostic would cover a wide range of views. There are lots of different religions that people have called gnostic. But one thing that most of them have in common is the idea that the body is not what matters. The body is not your friend, and God did not create the body. The body is a cosmic disaster. It's why we experience so much pain and suffering because we live in these material shells. And in most gnostic religions, the idea is to get out of the shell, to escape the shell. So they have very much a differentiation between soul and body. It comes - Gnosticism, in some ways, comes out of Greek thinking. So for them, there's no resurrection of the dead.",
            "Here\u2019s what I mean. Jesus tells us that in heaven people won\u2019t get married but will be like the angels (Luke 20:35-36). So in heaven my wife will no longer be my wife \u2013 though that doesn\u2019t mean you can go hitting on her! At the same time, heaven is the consummation of marriage and is what the best human marriages could only point to and foreshadow. Notice how the apostle John goes on to describe heaven in his Revelation. He sees \u201cthe New Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband \u201d (Revelation 21:2, emphasis added). This wife/bride imagery isn\u2019t new to John, since marriage in its original design (laid out in Genesis) was meant to foreshadow the union of God and his people, Christ and his church. Heaven is the consummation of this marriage.",
            "What are heaven and hell like? Why are heaven and hell important to us now? How do we answer questions our friends have about heaven and hell? \r Let\u2019s take these in order. 1. What are heaven and hell like? The Bible tells us a lot about heaven and hell. But before we jump into those facts, I\u2019d like to toss some mental stowaways overboard. First, let\u2019s make clear what isn\u2019t true about heaven. Heaven isn\u2019t now. Somewhere in the world, between twenty-five and thirty wars are being fought right now. Enough said. Heaven isn\u2019t for everyone. Some people won\u2019t be there. I know that sounds harsh and exclusive, but it\u2019s the truth. We\u2019ll get to this more later. Heaven isn\u2019t cute and ethereal. I\u2019m not judging you if you have Precious Moments figurines on your bookshelf or mantle; I\u2019m just saying heaven will not look like those. Nor will heaven look like what we see in cartoons or movies, where we float on clouds and God is Morgan Freeman.",
            "And in the end, Jesus will do more than speak about judgment. When he comes again, he will personally judge the world (Acts 17:31). The same Jesus depicted as blessing the little children is described by John in his Revelation as \u201csomeone \u2018like a son of man\u2019 dressed in a robe reaching down to his feet and with a golden sash around his chest.\u201d His hand and hair were white like wool, as white as snow, and his eyes were like blazing fire. His feet were like bronze glowing in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of rushing waters. In his right hand he held seven stars, and out of his mouth came a sharp double-edged sword. His face was like the sun shining in all its brilliance (1:13-16). People who misunderstand Jesus tend to dichotomize love and justice, grace and truth. But these qualities are wed in the person of Christ, nailed together on the cross. Is hell really forever?",
            "The new earth: created and hospitable \r One of the things Christians often overlook is how earthy are the descriptions of heaven (the new earth) found in Scripture. For example, you\u2019ll find many literary connections between Genesis 1-3 and Revelation 21-22, where the old creation and new creation are compared and contrasted. Here are but a few of those connections: In making this connection, Scripture is driving several blocks out of its way to let us know that heaven will not be ethereal but the fulfillment and full flowering of creation. I\u2019m not saying there will be zip codes or anything like that, but heaven will be physical, earthy, and material. Our temptation to think of it otherwise is subbiblical and leads us to picture it as clouds or fog or like LA during a smog alert \u2013 not very inspiring imagery.",
            "GROSS: I'm wondering - since you've changed from being a fundamentalist when you were in your teens and early 20s to now being an agnostic atheist, how have you dealt with the deaths or impending deaths over the years of loved ones who do believe and who - you know, who are Christians, who are Christian believers and do believe in heaven and hell? Like, I'm sure you don't want to talk them out of their beliefs. But it's not what you believe. EHRMAN: Yeah. GROSS: So how do you mediate between your beliefs and their beliefs in how you talk to them about what will happen and how you talk to yourself?",
            "And so he came up with the idea that he would have a temporary residence up with Christ in God's realm, in heaven, until the end came. And so this is what the later Paul has to say, and this is the beginning of the Christian idea of heaven and hell, that you can exist - even though your physical remains are dead, you can exist in the presence of God in heaven. And once Paul started saying that, his followers really latched onto it because most of Paul's converts were from Greek circles. They were gentiles. They weren't Jews. And they had been raised with the idea that your soul lives on after death, and now they had a Christian model to put it on. They could say that, yes, your soul lives on, and so when you die, your soul will go up to God with heaven. And as time went on, that became the emphasis rather than the idea of the resurrection with the dead. GROSS: How does hell come into it?",
            "Here\u2019s what C. S. Lewis had to say about it: In the long run the answer to all those who object to the doctrine of hell is itself a question: \u201cWhat are you asking God to do?\u201d To wipe out their past sins and, at all costs, to give them a fresh start, smoothing every difficulty and offering every miraculous help? But He has done so, on Calvary. To forgive them? They will not be forgiven. To leave them alone? Alas, I am afraid that is what he does. 6 But that still leaves us with a major question. Are heaven and hell relevant only to our eternal state, or do they have an impact in this life? 2. Why are heaven and hell important to us now? Wasn\u2019t it Albert Camus who thought that our only real decision in life is when to kill ourselves? The perspective of Camus, being an atheist, makes the point that what we believe about the afterlife casts a shadow on how we live here.",
            "EHRMAN: I think one of the hardest things for people to get their minds around is that ancient Israelites and then Jews and then Jesus himself and his followers have a very different understanding of what the relationship between what we call body and soul. Our view is that we - you've got two things going on in the human parts. So you have your body, your physical being, and you have your soul, this invisible part of you that lives on after death, that you can separate the two and they can exist - the soul can exist outside of the body. That is not a view that was held by ancient Israelites and then Jews, and it's not even taught in the Old Testament.",
            "Some may argue that hell will not literally be dark, that darkness is simply a metaphor. It is most certainly a metaphor, but why not descriptive of reality as well? Half night and half day is a fairly apt metaphor for life in this world, and \u2013 wuddaya know? \u2013 it literally is twelve or so hours a day of each. My point is that the physical is deeply enmeshed in the spiritual, just as humans are an amalgam of body and soul. We should therefore be careful of dichotomies, seeing descriptions as only true of the spiritual state of affairs and not the physical. If our world is any indicator of the organic relationship between the physical and spiritual, there\u2019s good reason to assume that the meeting of utter moral and spiritual darkness will not take place in a festival of light (Revelation 21:22-24). Lake of fire",
            "(SOUNDBITE OF MICHAEL NYMAN'S \"HOW DO I KNOW YOU KNOW?\" GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Bart Ehrman, author of the new book \"Heaven And Hell: A History Of The Afterlife.\" He's a distinguished professor of religious studies at The University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill and the author of many books about early Christianity. You know, you write in your book that it's hard for you to conceive of God as being a sadist who would torture people for eternity in hell. EHRMAN: Right. So the bottom line of the book is that the way you kind of trace the history of heaven and hell is that when people thought that everybody dies and it's the same for everybody forever, they thought, well, that's not fair. Surely, if there are gods in the world or God in the world, there has to be justice. So suffering now must be rewarded later, and wicked behavior now must be punished later. And so they came up with the idea of an afterlife with rewards and punishments.",
            "Similarly, hell is a monument to free will. Or as G. K. Chesterton put it, \u201cHell is God\u2019s great compliment to the reality of human freedom and dignity of human choice.\u201d At some point God stops bridling people and lets them go, giving them what they want, giving them what they deserve. Display of justice \r The cross is the clearest display of God\u2019s justice this side of eternity, and we learn a number of things about God and his character by looking at it. God is a God of justice. Through the Cross, he punished the sins of everyone who would ever trust in Christ. God\u2019s justice is inseparable from his love, wisdom, and power (Acts 2:23; Romans 5:8; Ephesians 3:10). If they could be separated, we would not be looking at a crucified Savior absorbing God\u2019s judgment out of love for us. Believers have seen God\u2019s justice in the Cross and will praise him forever (Revelation 7:10). Those who persist in their rebellion will experience God\u2019s justice in hell firsthand.",
            "Didn\u2019t Jesus teach about love and forgiveness, not hell and judgment? \r Of course Jesus was about grace and forgiveness, but to see him in that light alone is a distortion. He is a Lion and a Lamb (Revelation 5:5-6). The Jesus who said to turn the other cheek is the same one who turned over tables in the temple and addressed the religious leaders with such sentiments as \u201c ... hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead men\u2019s bones and everything unclean\u201d (Matthew 23:27). Does that sound like Ned Flanders to you? As a matter of fact, Jesus spoke more about hell than anyone else recorded in Scripture (In Matthew alone: 3:12; 7:22-23; 10:28; 13:30, 41-42, 47-50; 33; 25:10, 19-31, 33, 41, 46; 26:24).",
            "Hell Hell, according to many religious beliefs, is an afterlife of suffering where the wicked or unrighteous dead are punished. Hell is almost always depicted as underground. Within Islam hell is traditionally depicted as fiery. Some other traditions, however, portray Hell as cold and gloomy. Punishment in Hell typically corresponds to sins committed in life.",
            "Gnostics disagreed with the Jewish idea that at the end of time, God would raise the dead physically. For Gnostics, the idea of being raised in your body was repulsive. You mean I've got to live in this thing forever? No. Real life is in the soul. And so they denied the idea of the resurrection of the body. And what is interesting is Gnostics then claimed that Jesus also denied it. And so when you read the Gnostic Gospels, you find Jesus denouncing the idea that there's a resurrection of the body or that life will be lived eternally in the body; it's strictly a matter of the soul. And the other interesting thing is that what the Gnostics did, by reading their ideas into Jesus, is also what the Orthodox Christians did, by putting words in Jesus' lips that supported their ideas of heaven and hell. And so in our various Gospels, you have Jesus saying all sorts of things that are contradictory because different people are putting their own ideas onto his lips.",
            "What, after all, makes spoiled brats spoiled? Isn\u2019t it that they see themselves as deserving, as entitled to the privilege they enjoy? What spoiled brats need is to spend a summer in Third World squalor. Then they\u2019ll understand how undeserving and blessed they truly are. This is what the contemplation of hell does for us. Without it, we would become spiritual brats. It is Jesus alone \u201cwho rescues us from the coming wrath\u201d (1 Thessalonians 1:10). Hell squashes pride, grows humility, and rips the ice cream cone out of the hands of our inner brat. Humility from the perspective of hea ven \r How do you humble the human heart? Treat it like a mutt and rub its nose in what its done or treat it like Paris Hilton and give it a Porsche for doing absolutely nothing. The horrors of hell show us what our sin deserves, while heaven\u2019s shocking and garish display of grace shows us how unworthy we are. Heaven humbles us from the opposite direction.",
            "One misconception people have of heaven is that it is rural. Though the Bible begins with Adam and Eve in a garden setting, heaven is described in Revelation as \u201cthe Holy City, the New Jerusalem\u201d (21:2). Heaven, or the new earth, will be communal. We won\u2019t be scattered across our world like settlers or angelic pig farmers, but we will interact and live life concentrated together. The city, New Jerusalem, is described as holy. With this city will come culture, but it won\u2019t be culture shaped by rebellion and idolatry. The new heavens and the new earth will be cooler \u2013 cooler than LA, cooler than Soho, way cooler than Idaho. Tragically, it\u2019s hard to picture a godly culture of staggering beauty. Have you ever cringed at the thought of a Christian movie? Christians want to be biblically accurate, which is honorable, but then do a so-so job in other aspects of the movie. This makes us anticipate the culture of heaven to be of B-movie quality.",
            "Hell Muslims believe in jahannam (in Arabic: \u062c\u0647\u0646\u0645) (which comes from the Hebrew word gehennim and resembles the versions of Hell in Christianity). In the Qur'an, the holy book of Islam, there are literal descriptions of the condemned in a fiery Hell, as contrasted to the garden-like Paradise ( jannah ) enjoyed by righteous believers. In addition, Heaven and Hell are split into many different levels depending on the actions perpetrated in life, where punishment is given depending on the level of evil done in life, and good is separated into other levels depending on how well one followed God while alive. There is an equal number of mentions of both Hell and paradise in the Qur'an, which is considered by believers to be among the numeric miracles in the Qur'an.[citation needed]",
            "EHRMAN: Well, the same advice everybody's getting who's listening to the right news sources, which is that you need to self-isolate. You simply - it is going to be a disaster for some way - somewhere, on some level, for the economy, but it'll be a worse disaster if we are out in public because we could be spreading the virus. We have to self-isolate. And so I'm - my wife and I have been completely self-isolated for a week now, and we're going to stay this way. And it's really the only way to stop this thing from growing. It's going to grow. It'll be exponential. But it's the only way to stop it. GROSS: So does that mean you're not leaving the house at all? EHRMAN: Just to go out in my yard. I'll occasionally walk around the block if nobody's around. But other than that, no. We aren't using our cars. We're not going out. We're not doing anything else. We're staying - absolutely staying inside, and we're in the yard.",
            "Hell In Hinduism , there are contradictions as to whether or not there is a Hell (referred to as 'Narak' in Hindi). For some it is a metaphor for a conscience. But in Mahabharata there is a mention of the Pandavas and the Kauravas going to Hell. Hells are also described in various Puranas and other scriptures. Garuda Purana gives a detailed account on Hell, its features and enlists amount of punishment for most of the crimes like modern day penal code.",
            "Hope Usually we use hope to refer to a possibility without guarantee (\u201cI hope I can fill up my gas tank for under $500\u201d). In the Bible, hope is tied to promise, not possibility. That is, hope is waiting for a promise to be fulfilled: \u201cLet us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is faithful\u201d (Hebrews 10:23). Here\u2019s how heaven and hell instill hope. Hope from the perspective of h ell \r Contemplating hell reminds us that no matter how bad or bleak things seem, while we are in this world, there is still hope. In an episode of ER a patient overcome with guilt and anguish tries to commit suicide by injecting himself with some horrible drug that I can\u2019t remember (perhaps diet Mountain Dew). George, one of the ER doctors, slaps the syringe out of his hand. To which the suicidal patient responds, \u201cI am in hell. Don\u2019t you understand? I am in hell already. I might as well die.\u201d",
            "Heaven In Hinduism, with its emphasis on reincarnation, the concept of Heaven is not as prominent. While heaven is temporary (until the next birth), the permanent state that Hindus aspire to is Moksha. Moksha is seen as the soul's liberation from the cycle of life and death, a re-establishment in one's own fundamental divine nature and may include union with or joining God. Entry into heaven (swarga loka) or hell (Naraka) is decided by the Lord of death Yama and his karmic accountant, Chitragupta, who records the good and bad deeds of a person during his lifetime. It must be noted that Yama and Chitragupta are subordinate to the supreme Lord Ishwara (God) and work under his direction. Entry into heaven is only dependent on ones actions in the previous life and is not restricted by faith or religion. The ruler of heaven, where one enjoys the fruits of ones good deeds, is known as Indra and life in that realm is said to include interaction with many celestial beings (gandharvas).",
            "Heaven While the concept of heaven (malkuth hashamaim \u05de\u05dc\u05db\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05e9\u05de\u05d9\u05dd\u2014 The Kingdom of Heaven ) is well-defined within the Christian and Islamic religions, the Jewish concept of the afterlife, sometimes known as \" olam haba \", the world to come, seems to have been disputed between various early sects such as the Sadducees , and thus never set forth in a systematic or official fashion as was done in Christianity and Islam. Jewish writings refer to a \"new earth\" as the abode of mankind following the resurrection of the dead. Judaism does, however, have a belief in Heaven, not as a future abode for \"good souls\", but as the \"place\" where God \"resides\". Jewish mysticism recognizes seven heavens . In order from lowest to highest, the seven Heavens are listed alongside the angels who govern them and any further information: Shamayim : The first Heaven, governed by Archangel Gabriel , is the closest of heavenly realms to the Earth; it is also considered the abode of Adam and Eve .",
            "It\u2019s easy to blur these concepts. I blur them in this article. Even in Scripture, vision into the future is often blurry lacking distinction and clarity. Some theologians have suggested the following taxonomy of terms and I think it\u2019s a helpful way to understand them even if at times we use them interchangeably: When a Christian dies, he or she enters into what theologians call the intermediate state, a transitional period between our past lives on Earth and our future resurrection to life on the New Earth. Usually when werefer to \u201cHeaven,\u201d we mean the place that Christians go when they die. When wetell ourchildren \u201cGrandma\u2019s now in Heaven,\u201d we\u2019re referring to the intermediate Heaven.",
            "The description of fire also carries with it the idea of duration, at least in Jesus\u2019 use of the imagery. \u201cIt is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell, where \u201c \u2018their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched\u2019 \u201d (Mark 9:48). This is the horror of hell: its absolute finality and hopelessness. Torture, rape, war, incest \u2013 there are unquestionably staggering atrocities suffered in this life, but what makes hell to be hell is that it is without end.",

            "Heaven isn\u2019t a state of mind or a mindless state. In some forms of Eastern thought, people aspire to be liberated from cravings, anger, and afflictive states. Nirvana is where there is nothing and where nothing is grasped. However, heaven is not nirvana. Similarly, let\u2019s shed some extra baggage on hell: Hell isn\u2019t funny. Gary Larson\u2019s Far Side comics are often hilarious, but what he depicts about heaven, and especially about hell, are just plain wrong. No one will ever laugh in hell. Hell isn\u2019t a bearable annoyance. Often we are led to think that hell is just a bad hair day stretched out for a long time. Or something like this crosses our mind: My life is hell.

Zamhareer is seen as the coldest and the most freezing Hell of all, yet its coldness is not seen as a pleasure or a relief to the sinners who committed crimes against God. The state of the Hell of Zamhareer is a suffering of extreme coldness of blizzards ice and snow which no one on this earth can bear. The lowest pit of all existing Hells is the Hawiyah which is meant for the Hypocrites and two-faced people who claimed to believe in Allah and His messenger by the tongue but denounced both in their hearts.

And so in some of his later letters, he ponders the possibility of death, and he wonders, well, what happens to me, then? If I'm brought into the presence of Christ at the resurrection, and, you know, there's a gap between the time I die and - what happens to me during that gap?

            "Could our refusal to talk about death actually be unbelief \u2013 doubting that heaven holds a better life for us than this one? Or is it simply a matter of an attention deficit \u2013 being captivated by motion and distracted by shiny objects that herd our thoughts toward temporary, fleeting, vanishing things? Like a funeral, heaven and hell can be nothing more than the pleasant or not-sopleasant afterthoughts of our Christian life. But they were intended to be the lifeblood that animates it, much as they do the Scriptures. For even when not explicitly referred to, these two realities lie just beneath the words of every page of Scripture. In this article we want to uncover what is implicit in every page of Scripture and every day of our fleeting lives, and that is this point: heaven and hell, not the here and now of this world, are the ultimate reality. Three considerations should provide us some needed perspective: What are heaven and hell like?",
            "Interestingly, Scripture\u2019s only other use of this consuming fire imagery is as a description of God\u2019s holiness and judgment: \u201cOur \u2018God is a consuming fire\u2019\u201d (Hebrews 12:29). This has led some to suggest that for those who are in Christ, God\u2019s holiness will be an unending source of praise, while for those who have rejected God (still in their sin), it will be an eternal consuming fire. If this were the case, hell would obviously not be the absence of God but his unbearable presence. Gnashing of teeth",

The gates of teshuva (return) are said to be always open, and so one can align his will with that of God at any moment. Being out of alignment with God's will is itself a punishment according to the Torah . Also, Subbotniks and Messianic Judaism believe in Gehenna, but Samaritans probably believe in a separation of the wicked in a shadowy existence, Sheol, and the righteous in heaven.",
            "Gloom of darkness \r There is a gothic thread of blackness woven through the Bible. Tracing this theme, darkness is seen to be the realm in which Satan rules or operates (Luke 22:53; Colossians 1:13; 1 Peter 2:9), a way of communicating hopelessness and despair (Psalms 88:18; 107:10) or behavior and lifestyles that are evil and ungodly (John 3:19; Ephesians 5:8-11). If God is light, then darkness is associated with all that is against him. Except for those of us living in Alaska, our days are generally divided between darkness and light. This is undoubtedly not an accident but instead a live-in metaphor for our spiritual reality: this world is filled with both the blessings of God as well as the darkness of sin and Satan. But again, this world is not ultimate. It is either dusk or dawn for people here, and we are all heading to a place of light or darkness, the rightful inhabitation for the children of God or the fitting destination for his enemies.",
            "Holiness Holiness from the perspective of hell \r One of the things that happens to us as we reflect on hell is that we see sin for what it is and we learn to take it more seriously. I\u2019m not a doctor. Medically speaking, I know as much about the inner workings of cancer as I do about the digestive system of marsupials. Okay, I don\u2019t even know what a marsupial is. But I take cancer seriously, and I do so because I\u2019ve seen its results. I know what it does and where it leads. Likewise, knowing that the end result of sin is hell, and knowing how horrible hell is, causes me to take sin seriously. If the Scripture said the punishment for sin were a thirtyminute timeout in the corner of heaven, I\u2019d give it little thought. Consequences reflect and define the severity of the offense. Should you find yourself in a state penitentiary, you don\u2019t want to bunk with the guy serving five life sentences \u2013 whatever he did, it can\u2019t be good.",

Again, John is our tour guide: Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea. I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, \u201cNow the dwelling of God is with men, and he will live with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God.\u201d (Revelation 21:1-3)",
            "I have to say that I don\u2019t think the doctrine of hell is intuitive. No more than the Cross is. Both are equally scandalous to reason. Both are foolishness to the world. While as believers we can see the initial contours of their wisdom, neither hell nor the Cross is truly comprehensible from earth\u2019s vantage point. The Scriptures help us to begin to see that vantage point, but not until we see God face-to-face and behold the infinite beauty of his being will hell seem right. We cannot fully comprehend hell\u2019s justness, nor the Cross\u2019s, until we fully comprehend who has been mocked, rejected, and despised. Ultimate Ends \r As I said in the beginning, heaven and hell are not a tacked-on doctrines, mere parting gifts. We are all on a spiritual journey, all heading toward one destination or the other. Heaven and hell are the ultimate and logical ends of the journey. Here\u2019s what C. S. Lewis had to say about it:",
            "The book is all about the terrible destruction that is going to take place on Earth when God destroys everything that is opposed to him, before bringing in a good kingdom. And so all of the imagery of death and destruction and disease and war in the Book of Revelation is used to show what terrible measures God has to take in order to destroy the forces of evil that are completely - have completely infiltrated the human world, before he brings in a new world. This, though, is not a book that describes what's going to happen to individuals when they die and go to heaven or hell; it's a description of the final judgment of God that somehow is going to be coming to Earth.",

When people need to find life pleasant and hopeful and they need to be helpful to other people, they need to enjoy life, if all you're looking forward to is what's going to happen after you die, you can't really fully enjoy life now because this is just a dress rehearsal. And so I don't try to talk people out of their view of heaven, but I think, actually, it's better off, you know, not living for what's going to happen after you die; it's better off living for what you can do now.

            "What the Bible Says About Heaven Here are the biblical posts that frame what we know about heaven. While we may at times make some biblically informed speculations about heaven, this is not that. What we are looking at here are the explicit teachings of Scripture, which must inform any speculation. We must first, however, begin with an important clarification between heaven and the new earth or new creation. Scripture teaches that when we die we go to be with Christ, immediately joining him in heaven. For example, Jesus tells the thief crucified along with him, \u201ctoday you will be with me in paradise\u201d (Luke 23:43). The Scripture also speaks of a new earth: a transformed creation that will be the eternal dwelling place of God\u2019s people.",
            "Though the temple is not a building, it is a place. In fact, the new earth itself is a temple. It\u2019s like the temple expanded and took over the entire earth, one giant location, covered with God\u2019s people, where God chooses to dwell, \u201cFor the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea\u201d (Habakkuk 2:14). Conclusion: heaven is mor e \r Envisioning heaven is not without its challenges. In particular, there is the tendency to see biblical symbolism as reality, to see heaven as ethereal, and to think of heaven in terms of negations: what won\u2019t be there\u2014marriage, sin, pain, sorrow, and so forth. I like how Lewis describes the effect negation has on our imagination.",
            "The book that I'm writing that I'm now calling \"Expecting Armageddon\" is all about that. It's about how people have misused the Book of Revelation to talk about how the end is coming and how it always seems like it's going to be coming in our own time. And everybody thinks this is as bad as it can be. And, you know, this time we may have it right. This kind of thinking, though, really came to prominence at the end of the 19th and into the 20th century and hit big prominence in 1945, when we actually had the means of destroying ourselves off the planet, which we still have, by the way. People aren't talking about nuclear weapons anymore, but they probably should be because that's another way this whole thing might end. But now the talk is more about climate change, as it should be. We absolutely may do it to ourselves this time, but it won't be a prediction - a fulfillment of predictions of a prophecy; it'll be because of human stupidity and refusal to act in the face of crisis.",
            "Hell In Christianity, the popularly used word Hell, however, is a translation of three Greek words: hades, Gehenna, and Tartarus. Hades, literally meaning unseen, usually refers to the state of death, which is defined by some as a conscious waiting place for resurrection, and by others as a state of unconsciousness synonymous with death itself. Gehenna, on the other hand, more ambiguous than hades, seems to refer to judgment and fits more closely with the modern conceptions of Hell. Tartarus is used in reference to the judgment of sinning angels and seems to be an allusion to Greek mythology (see Tartarus ).",
            "But God created beauty; the greatest artists of human history manifest but an anemic reflection of his artistry. So imagine a worldwide culture whose desire is to see the justice, holiness, truth, love, and grandeur of God\u2019s being expressed in all its fullness, with capacities greater than Monet or Michelangelo to express it. If there were graffiti in such a city (which I doubt), it would be of more value than a Rembrandt. It\u2019s hard to not think of a city without attaching to it crime, trash, and traffic. That\u2019s because cities concentrate sinful humanity \u2013 they magnify our sinfulness and rebellion, catalyze it, excite it like uranium in a nuclear reactor. This is a bit off-color, but have you ever thought about sewage? It\u2019s what comes out of us. It is inseparably tied to what it means to be human. We put out waste.

            "The concept of heaven in Islam is similar to that found in Judaism and Christianity. The Qur'an contains many references to an afterlife in Eden for those who do good deeds. Heaven itself is commonly described in the Qu'ran in verse 35 of Surah Al-Ra\u2019d: \"The parable of the Garden which the righteous are promised! Beneath it flow rivers. Perpetual is the fruits thereof and the shade therein. Such is the End of the Righteous; and the end of the unbelievers is the Fire, wherein a person dwells forever.\" Since Islam rejects the concept of original sin , Muslims believe that all human beings are born pure and will naturally turn to God, but it is their environment and lack of will power which influences them to choose ungodly ways of life. In Islam, therefore, a child who dies automatically goes to heaven, regardless of the religion of his or her parents. The highest level of heaven is Firdaws (\u0641\u0631\u062f\u0648\u0633)- Pardis (\u067e\u0631\u062f\u06cc\u0633), which is where the prophets, the martyrs and the most truthful",

The two realities are on extreme opposite trajectories, making heaven unfathomably amazing and hell unthinkably hideous. Because hell is a difficult doctrine, one that we may be tempted to explain or smirk away, it\u2019s critical that we focus on the biblical data. As the great nineteenth-century preacher Charles Spurgeon admonishes: Some have staggered over the doctrine of eternal punishment, because they could not see how that could be consistent with God\u2019s goodness. I have only one question to ask concerning that: Does God reveal it in the Scriptures? Then believe it, and leave to him the vindication of his own consistency. If we do not see it to be so, it will be nonetheless so because we are blind. 5 Gloom of darkness",
            "What about people who have never heard the gospel? \r This article doesn\u2019t afford enough space to adequately address this issue; it will be treated in a separate article in the Critical Concept Series. All we can say from Scripture is this: We are all deserving of hell apart from Christ. God goes to great length to get the gospel to people. Believers have a responsibility to proclaim the gospel to the world. Some people suggest that there is a plan B to salvation. For example, they may say that God knows those who would have trusted him, if given the chance, and that he redeems them on that basis. But if God has a plan B, he has not seen fit to tell us about it in Scripture. Therefore, we should labor to share the gospel as though there is no such a plan (as there very well may not be). There\u2019s only one person smart enough to figure out what to do with each and every person on the planet, and he\u2019s on top of it. So don\u2019t worry about it.",
            "Is hell really forever? \r Yes, it is, though it\u2019s easy to understand why people would rather believe it isn\u2019t. Hell is a difficult thing to talk about, but it is not for us to defend God or cover up this aspect of his gracious revelation. Hell is not a doctrinal blemish on God\u2019s face. And one of the most loving things we can do for others is to stand firm about hell as the consequence for our rebellion apart from Christ. Nevertheless, people go on trying to soften hell. Their attempts typically fall into one of these alternatives: Denying the existence of hell altogether Believing that no one is actually banished to hell Shortening the duration of hell\u2019s punishment by (a) saying that the wicked eventually repent in hell and move up to heaven, or (b) saying that the wicked eventually are destroyed by the fire and are annihilated out of existence In short, people try to get rid of, bypass, or shorten hell.",

Now, back to our question \u201cWhat are heaven and hell like?\u201d We should begin by keeping the big picture in mind. Heaven and hell are not ideas tacked onto a religious faith, manipulating people into adherence to some moral code. They are part of the larger story we see through the pages of Scripture. Heaven and hell are the final, ultimate, and logical ends of the story \u2013 ends we all decide for ourselves without coercion.",
            "I don't take that literally anymore because I don't believe there is. I'm open to it, and I hope there is something after death, and if it is, it'll be good. But I personally think, probably, this life is all there is. But I take the Easter story as a metaphor that, even in the darkest hours when there looks to be no hope and it looks like it's simply the end of all things, there actually is a glimmer of hope and that something good can come out of something very bad. And so I really believe that, and I'll probably always believe it. GROSS: So what are you doing to stay safe? You live in North Carolina.

            "Heaven Historically, Christianity has taught \"Heaven\" as a generalized concept, a place of eternal life, in that it is a shared plane to be attained by all the pious and elect (rather than an abstract experience related to individual concepts of the ideal). The Christian Church has been divided over how people gain this eternal life. From the 16th to the late 19th century, Christendom was divided between the Roman Catholic view, the Orthodox view, the Coptic view, the Jacobite view, the Abyssinian view and Protestant views.",
            "Harvest Sticking with the H theme, I\u2019m calling the last one \u201charvest,\u201d as in spiritual harvest. And those who are not harvested for salvation in this life stand to be harvested for judgment at the end of time (Revelation 14:14-20). Harvest from the perspective of hell \r It is not emotionally manipulative, then, to warn those who have not trusted in Christ of hell. After all, the reality of hell is the truth \u2013 a hard truth, but the truth nonetheless. Apart from Christ, there is no hope, only \u201ca fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume the enemies of God\u201d (Hebrews 10:27). Contemplating hell should instill in us a sense of urgency. Not only is life short but also in its shortness our eternal destinies are decided. We make our beds in this life and sleep in them in the next (I\u2019m rather pleased with how I stated that).",

            "It is believed that people who commit 'paap' (sin) go to Hell and have to go through the punishments in accordance to the sins they committed. The god Yama, who is also the god of death, is the king of Hell. The detailed accounts of all the sins committed by an individual are supposed to be kept by Chitragupta who is the record keeper in Yama's court. Chitragupta reads out the sins committed and Yama orders the appropriate punishments to be given to the individuals. These punishments include dipping in boiling oil, burning in fire, torture using various weapons etc. in various Hells. Individuals who finish their quota of the punishments are reborn according to their karma. All of the created are imperfect and thus have at least one sin to their record, but if one has led a generally pious life, one ascends to Heaven, or Swarga after a brief period of expiation in Hell.",

If we don\u2019t keep our eyes on heaven, their focus invariably lowers to the horizon of this world, and that inevitably brings disappointment, even despair. We were made for eternity. If pondering our eternal destination is escapism, then the message of Jesus in the Gospels is, go to expedia.com and book some tickets!

            "In the Old Testament, what we would call the soul is really more like what we would call the breath. When God creates Adam, he creates him out of earth, and then he breathes life into him. The life is in the breath. When the breath leaves the body, the body no longer lives, but the breath doesn't exist. We agree with this. I mean, when you die, you stop breathing. Your breath doesn't go anywhere. And that was the ancient understanding, the ancient Hebrew understanding of the soul, is that it didn't go anywhere because it was simply the thing that made the body alive. And so in the Old Testament, there's no idea that your soul goes one place or another because the soul doesn't exist apart from the body. Existence is entirely bodily. And that was the view that Jesus then picked up. GROSS: Are there specific passages in the Hebrew Bible that support the notion of an afterlife?",

What it says is that Samuel came up, but it doesn't say where he was, and it doesn't say if he was living at the time.

Other doctrines, like the zinc in my Centrum vitamin, you can go without for a while, but sooner or later you\u2019ll begin to feel the motivational effects, a lagging in spiritual vitality. The doctrines of heaven and hell provide spiritual motivations far beyond eternal security. Hope, humility, holiness, and the harvest are but some of them. We may not reflect upon heaven and hell every day, or need to, but to ignore them will have serious long-term effects on spiritual motivation. And not only do we need to pay attention to these doctrines of heaven and hell for our own benefit, but also we should brush up on them because others are interested too.

            "EHRMAN: Right. So this is a really important shift for understanding both the history of later Judaism and the history of later Christianity and the historical Jesus. About 200 before Jesus was born, there was a shift in thinking in ancient Israel that became - it became a form of ideology, a kind of religious thought that scholars today call apocalypticism. It has to do with the apocalypse, the revelation of God. These people began to think that the reason there is suffering in the world is not what the prophets had said, that it - because people sin and God is punishing them; it's because there are forces of evil in the world that are aligned against God and his people who are creating suffering. And so you get these demonic forces in the world that are creating misery for everyone.",

And so I don't - it's not that I think that I believe only rational things and everybody else is irrational. I have a different set of beliefs. But my firmest belief is that whatever we believe, it should not do harm in the world; it should do good in the world. And of course, belief in heaven and hell has done a lot of good; it's also done a lot of harm. It has terrified people. There are people who are terrified of dying because they're afraid - they are literally afraid that they will be tormented for trillions of years, just as the beginning. And I think that's a harmful belief.",
            "Gnashing of teeth \r I\u2019ve heard it suggested that hell will be hell only from the vantage point of heaven. In other words, hell will have a certain appeal for those who inhabit it. This vision of hell reminds me of the postapocalyptic movies where quarantined zones (usually the island of Manhattan) are set aside as the lawless playground of zombies or street gangs free to do whatever their evil hearts desire. But Jesus, on multiple occasions, used the vivid words \u201cwailing and gnashing of teeth\u201d to speak of the sorrow, regret, and pain experienced in hell (Matthew 8:12; 13:42, 50; 22:13). From his description, I take it that hell will be hell to those who are in it. They will not enjoy it, not even perversely so. Reward for sin \r Reward for sin \u201cThe wages of sin are death\u201d (Romans 6:23; see also 2:5-11). What do people who never turn from their sin receive? Hell. What does all their labor and passion given toward their own selfish desires earn them? Hell.",
            "Roman Catholics believe that entering Purgatory after death (physical rather than ego death) cleanses one of sin (period of suffering until one's nature is perfected), which makes one acceptable to enter heaven. This is valid for venial sin only, as mortal sins can be forgiven only through the act of reconciliation and repentance while on earth. Some within the Anglican Church also hold to this belief, despite their separate history. However, in Oriental Orthodox Churches , it is only God who has the final say on who enters heaven. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, heaven is understood as union and communion with the Triune God (reunion of Father and Son through love). Thus, Heaven is experienced by the Orthodox both as a reality inaugurated, anticipated and present here and now in the divine-human organism of the Christ's Body, the Church, and also as something to be perfected in the future. In some Protestant Christian sects, eternal life depends upon the sinner receiving",

But it\u2019s not only these heinous offenders who plunge into the underworld, for Scripture underscores that there will be precisely two \u2013 no more and no less \u2013 groups of people on Judgment Day: those who belong to God and those who prefer the devil\u2019s company. \u201cIf anyone\u2019s name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire\u201d (Revelation 20:15).",

            "The physical structure that stood in Jerusalem, the centerpiece of Israel\u2019s worship, was a shadow of the reality, which is Christ. The concept is further developed in the New Testament as we find that we as Christ\u2019s body are a part of this temple. We are living stones within it (1 Peter 2:5; Ephesians 2:21-22). It is no surprise, then, that John\u2019s vision of heaven in Revelation is of a glorious temple. But as Jesus and his people are (as we have seen) the new temple, it\u2019s probably best to see this as symbolism and not as a temple with a living room the size of Rhode Island. It is a temple in the sense that God is dwelling among his people.",
            "But what if my reward lay in seeing the blind reading? Pursuit of reward is not a misplaced motivation when the reward is the action in its fulfillment. As C. S. Lewis observes, we don\u2019t see love as mercenary when it seeks the reward of marriage or a general as selfish for seeking the reward of victory. I don\u2019t think it far from the mark to believe our rewards will be closely tied to our enjoyment of God, and this seems hinted at in many New Testament passages \u2013 \u201cBlessed are the pure in heart in heart, for they will see God\u201d (Matthew 5:8), for example. Jonathan Edwards described it like this: In heaven every person\u2019s capacity for joy will be completely filled, but some people will be rewarded with a greater capacity for joy.

Let\u2019s look at some of the more common ones. Won\u2019t worshiping God get boring? \r Let me say two things about this. First, maybe heaven would be boring if you equate worship strictly with singing \u201cShine, Jesus, Shine\u201d ad infinitum. But even if it were, you would still find extreme joy in praising Jesus because you will love him more than you could imagine. However, since worship in the Bible is never limited to just singing, then, no, heaven will not be boring. Worship will not be a specific activity you perform; it will be all that you are and all that you do.",

That became a view somewhat in Judaism, and it became a very pronounced view in Christianity. The - after Jesus. Jesus himself held to the apocalyptic view that I laid out. He taught - his main teaching is that the kingdom of God is coming. People today, when they read the phrase kingdom of God, they think he's talking about heaven, the place that your soul goes to when you die.

Sometimes Sheol is translated by the word hell, and it absolutely is not what people think of as hell. Sometimes Sheol is talked about by people today as a place that's kind of like the Greek Hades, a place where everybody goes after they die, and they aren't really physical beings down there; they're just kind of like souls, and they exist forever there, and there's nothing to do, and they do - they're all the same.

So you write that starting in the sixth century, Hebrew prophets began to proclaim, you know, that the nation had been destroyed and would be restored back to life by God.

Like all the different realms within cyclic existence, an existence in Hell is temporary for its inhabitants. Those with sufficiently negative karma are reborn there, where they stay until their specific negative karma has been used up, at which point they are reborn in another realm, such as that of humans , of hungry ghosts , of animals , of asuras , of devas , or of Naraka (Hell) all according to the individual's karma.",

It made me a rather obnoxious fundamentalist Christian because I thought that everybody else was going to go to hell, and so I had to go out of my way to convert them all (laughter).

Your forthcoming book that you're working on now is going to be called \"Expecting Armageddon.\" So how does the Book of Revelation contribute to the vision of hell? EHRMAN: Well, yeah. You know, a lot of people read Revelation as indicating that people who are opposed to God - sinners will be cast into the lake of fire forever, and they will be - yeah, they'll be floating in fire for eternity. And they get that from several passages in the Book of Revelation. I have to deal with this in my book, where I try to show that, in fact, the Book of Revelation does not describe eternal torment for sinners in the lake of fire. The - there are several beings that go into the lake of fire, but they are not human beings; they are the antichrist, the beast and the devil, and they are supernatural forces that are tormented forever.",

In fact, knowing and experiencing God\u2019s love over time can make the idea of hell, and especially the idea that we were ever bound there, unimaginable. We begin to think that God loves us for who we are, not because of how Christ has remade us. Yes, we are God\u2019s beloved children, but only because of Christ. Apart from Christ, the only side of God we would have experienced is his judgment.

            "Description While there are abundant and varied sources for conceptions of Heaven, the typical believer's view appears to depend largely on his religious tradition and particular sect. Generally religions agree on the concept of Heaven as pertaining to some type of peaceful life after death related to the immortality of the soul. Heaven is generally construed as a place of happiness , sometimes eternal happiness. Hell is often portrayed populated with demons, who torment the damned. Many are ruled by a death god, such as Nergal, the Hindu Yama, or some other dreadful supernatural figure (e.g. Satan).",

The gods were also from the lower worlds originally, but slowly and gradually graduated themselves into higher worlds by virtue of their past deeds and cultivation of virtuous qualities. Since there are many heavens and higher worlds of Brahma, these gods may evolve progressively from one heaven to another through their merit or descend into lower worlds due to some misfortune or right intention. The gods of Buddhism are therefore not immortal. Neither their position in the heavens is permanent. They may however live for longer durations of time. One of the Buddhist Sutras states that a hundred years of our existence is equal to one day and one night in the world of the thirty three gods. Thirty such days add up to their one month. Twelve such months become their one year, while they live for a thousand such years.",
            "EHRMAN: Yes. Yeah, of course. I mean, you know, a lot of people aren't joking. They take it very seriously. And it's - I want to say a couple of things about that. First is every generation from the time of Jesus till today has had Christians who insisted that the prophecies were coming true in their own day. There have always been people who actually picked a time when it's going to happen. And there are two things that you can say about every one of these people over history who've picked a time. One is they based their predictions on the Book of Revelation. And secondly, every one of them has been incontrovertibly wrong (laughter). So that should give one pause. The things that are happening now are absolutely dreadful as, of course, they were in 1916 to - 1914 to 1918 and as they have been at other times in history.",
            "Holiness from the perspective of heaven \r Heaven urges us to live a holy life, pursuing faithfulness even when we grow weary. The motivation is not just about the prospect of heaven but about the promise of reward. And in no place are these concepts as tightly bound than in the words of Jesus: \u201cRejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven\u201d (Matthew 5:12). Some struggle with the idea that we would serve God for a reward, seeing that motivation as selfish or perhaps utilitarian. I get that. But if it is not beneath God to promise reward, it should not be beneath us to aspire to it. I think this struggle flows from a distorted view of rewards. We\u2019re used to rewards having no connection with the action being rewarded. If you award me a trophy \u2013 say, a gold emasculated male holding a laurel wreath \u2013 for teaching Braille to the blind, I grant you that is absurd.",
            "What ends up happening is that, over time, this expectation that the kingdom was coming soon began to be questioned because it was supposed to come soon and it didn't come soon, and it's still not coming, and when is it going to come? And people started thinking, well, you know, surely I'm going to get rewarded, you know, not in some kingdom that's going to come in a few thousand years, but I'm going to get rewarded by God right away. And so they ended up shifting the thinking away from the idea that there'd be a kingdom here on Earth that was soon to come to thinking that the kingdom, in fact, is up with God above in heaven. And so they started thinking that it comes at death, and people started assuming then that, in fact, your soul would live on.",

            "Various interpretations of the torments of Hell exist, ranging from fiery pits of wailing sinners to lonely isolation from God's presence. However, the descriptions of Hell found in the Bible are quite vague. The books of Matthew, Mark, and Jude tell of a place of fire, while the books of Luke and Revelation report it as an abyss. Our modern, more graphic, images of Hell have developed from writings that are not found in the Bible. Dante's The Divine Comedy is a classic inspiration for modern images of Hell. Other early Christian writings also illustrate the anguish of Hell. Most Christians believe that damnation occurs immediately upon death ( particular judgment ), and others that it occurs after Judgment Day , which is written about in the book of Revelation .",

            "The people, in the Book of Revelation, human beings who aren't on the side of God, are actually destroyed. They are wiped out. This is the view that is fairly consistent throughout the New Testament, starting with Jesus. Jesus believed that people would be destroyed when - at the end of time, they'd be annihilated. So their punishment is they would not get the kingdom of God. That also is the view of Paul, that people would be destroyed if - when Jesus returns. It's not that they're going to live on forever. And it's the view of Revelation. People do not live forever. If they aren't brought into the new Jerusalem, the city of God that descends from heaven, they will be destroyed.

Extreme discontinuity would be to picture our bodies as something ghostlike and entirely spiritual \u2013 that\u2019s weird too. So he used, instead, the analogy of a seed.

            "According to the controversial website \" Religioustolerance.org \", \"Conservative and mainline Protestant denominations tend to base their belief in heaven on the literal interpretation of certain passages of the Bible, and symbolic interpretations of others.

            "Hell Judaism does not have a specific doctrine about the afterlife, but it does have a tradition of describing Gehenna . Gehenna is not Hell, but rather a sort of Purgatory where one is judged based on his or her life's deeds. The Kabbalah describes it as a \"waiting room\" (commonly translated as an \"entry way\") for all souls (not just the wicked). The overwhelming majority of rabbinic thought maintains that people are not in Gehenna forever; the longest that one can be there is said to be 11 months, however there has been the occasional noted exception. Some consider it a spiritual forge where the soul is purified for its eventual ascent to Olam Habah (heb. \u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd \u05d4\u05d1\u05d0; lit. \"The world to come\", often viewed as analogous to Heaven). This is also mentioned in the Kabbalah, where the soul is described as breaking, like the flame of a candle lighting another: the part of the soul that ascends being pure and the \"unfinished\" piece being reborn.",
            "If you take symbols to be reality, the reality will seem less real, disturbing even. Which is why my children were terrified by the Grinch movie. Cartoons \u2013 Dr. Seuss in particular \u2013 make for disturbing reality. Ironically, Scripture utilizes symbols because heaven will be far more real, beyond our ability to imagine. C. S. Lewis gives a helpful analogy of this called \u201ca very likely misconception\u201d: Let us picture a woman thrown into a dungeon. There she bears and raises a son. He grows up seeing nothing but the dungeon walls. This unfortunate woman was an artist and when they imprisoned her she managed to bring with her a drawing pad and a box of pencils.",
            "In speaking of our new life, Jesus stated, \u201cThe thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full\u201d (John 10:10). It\u2019s clearly Satan who\u2019s spraying graffiti on our portrait of heaven, always trying to make us think that heaven will be less. But, as Jesus made clear, eternal life is life in abundance, life super-sized: more beautiful, more logical, more creative, more personal, more loving, more active, more, more, more ... not less.",
            "EHRMAN: Paul is very important for understanding the history of heaven and hell, as he's important for understanding most things about early Christian thinking. Paul was not a follower of Jesus during his lifetime, during Jesus' lifetime. He wasn't one of the disciples. He converted several years after Jesus' death. He - Paul was Jewish. He was raised Jewish. He wasn't raised in Israel; he was from outside of Israel. He was a Greek-speaking Jew. But he was also, like Jesus, an apocalypticist who thought that at the end of the age, there would be a resurrection of the dead.",
            "When he became convinced that Jesus was raised from the dead, he thought that the resurrection had started. And so he talked about living in the last days because he assumed that everybody else now was going to be raised to follow suit. And so Paul thought he would be alive when the end came. For Paul, Jesus was going to come back from heaven and bring in God's kingdom here on Earth, and people would be raised from the dead for glorious eternity. Paul, in his earliest letters, affirms that view of the imminent resurrection. It's going to come very soon. And he fully expected to be alive when it happened.",
            "Hell is what we\u2019re owed, and Scripture reminds us that payday is never further than around the bend. \u201cBehold, I am coming soon!\u201d declares the risen Jesus. \u201cMy reward is with me, and I will give to everyone according to what he has done\u201d (Revelation 22:12). On that day we will all receive our paycheck. Apart from Christ, it will be hell. The first chapter of Romans focuses on God\u2019s judgment of sinful humanity and contains this sobering refrain: \u201cGod gave them over,\u201d \u201cGod gave them over,\u201d \u201che gave them over\u201d (verses 24, 26, 28). This phrase emphasizes an aspect of God\u2019s judgment we often overlook: God has given sinners what they wanted. That is, he has stopped restraining them from their sin and self-destruction. He has given them over to it.",
            "In Revelation we overhear the great chorus of the saints that will echo throughout eternity: \u201cSalvation belongs to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb\u201d (Revelation 7:10). Think about that. The gift of the gospel will be remembered forever. I can\u2019t even remember what I got for Christmas last year; how will I remember anything for eternity? Well, I would suggest that the experience of God and the experience of joy will be great enough to keep us humble forever. And I would also suggest that only an eternal hell would provide the complementing bookend to eternal humility. The blessings of God in our life are the first ripples of heaven. And while it\u2019s thankfulness that initially washes over us, a trough of humility should follow. I don\u2019t deserve this. How can this be?",
            "Second, realize that God isn\u2019t like a favorite song or movie. Those things are finite and created. Of course you would get bored with them. They weren\u2019t made to fill eternal appetites or longings. (When we try to use them like that, it\u2019s called idolatry.) By contrast, in true worship we explore the complexity and depth of God\u2019s beauty, majesty, wisdom, and glory forever. The more we learn of God, the more we will praise him. And the more we praise him, the more we will love him. And the more we love him, the more we will want to learn about him. ... It\u2019s a cycle of joy. It\u2019s happiness and love snowballing and never ending. Didn\u2019t Jesus teach about love and forgiveness, not hell and judgment?",
            "GROSS: How does hell come into it? EHRMAN: Well, so since these people believed that the soul was immortal, that you can kill the body but you can't kill the soul, they thought, well, OK, so our soul will go to heaven to be with God, but then they realized, well, what about the people who are not on the side of God? Well, if we're being rewarded, they're going to be punished. And that's how you start getting the development of the idea of hell, that it's a place where souls go to be punished in - as the opposite of the people who go to heaven to be rewarded. And in thinking this, as it turns out, the Christians are simply picking up on views that had been around among the Greeks since way back in the time of Plato. Plato also has ideas about souls living on, either to be rewarded or punished forever. And Christians now, who were mainly coming from Greek contexts, latched onto that idea with a Christian way of putting it.",
            "But they - these apocalyptic thinkers came to think that God was soon going to destroy these forces of evil and get rid of them altogether, and the world would again return to a utopia. It'd be like paradise. It'd be like the Garden of Eden once more. The people who thought that maintained that this Garden of Eden would come not only to people who happened to be alive when it arrived; it was going to come to everybody. People who had been on the side of God throughout history would be personally raised from the dead and individually would be brought into this new era, this new kingdom that God would rule here on Earth. GROSS: So this was all dependent on, like, the Messiah coming on the end of days, which some Jewish prophets predicted would be soon. When Jesus was alive, he thought the end of days would be soon. And of course, it kept not happening. EHRMAN: Yeah.",

            "Heaven further teaches that our efforts in the spiritual harvest will be rewarded. A part of that reward will be the eternal joy of knowing we played a role in someone\u2019s redemption. This is something the apostle Paul eagerly anticipated, \u201cWhat is our hope, our joy, or the crown in which we will glory in the presence of our Lord Jesus when he comes? Is it not you?\u201d (1 Thessalonians 2:19).",
            "GROSS: Is it fair to say you're an atheist now? EHRMAN: That is fair to say (laughter). I actually consider myself both an atheist and an agnostic because I - you know, I don't really know if there's a superior being in the universe, but I don't believe there is. And so in terms of what I know, I'm an agnostic. But in terms of what I believe, I'm an atheist. GROSS: In a time like this, do you wish you could still believe in a heaven that offers eternal life, in a place where you would be united with loved ones? EHRMAN: Yeah, that would absolutely be good. It's not that I wish I believed it; I wish that it were true. And as I say in my book, as we'll probably get to, it may be true that we will live after we die. But if we do, it'll be something pleasant like that. It's not going to be something awful. So I - you know, it's not that I wish I believed it so much as I wish that it were true. GROSS: So what do you believe about death now, about what happens after you die?",

            "Amen. WHITE PAPERS CRITICAL CONCEPT SERIES \u2022 VOLUME 1 The reason for the Critical Concept series is that there are important topics not covered in our Transferable Concepts that are, for any number of reasons, of critical concern to us today. Important concepts like this require more in-depth treatment, which is a discipleship challenge when so few are reading books. And so we have the Critical Concept series. Each article is roughly the length\u00a0of a book chapter - about 16 pages. So it\u2019s not a book, but it\u2019s not a pamphlet either. Volume 1 contains five booklets addressing the following topics: Heaven and Hell: Alternative Endings \r Worldviews: War of the Worlds \r God\u2019s Will: The Art of Discerning the Will of God \r Missions/ Great Commission: Mission Impossible \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \r Christ-centered Bible Study: Hearing the Music of the Gospel ORDER ONLINE AT\u00a0 CRUPRESS.COM",

            "The Islamic concept of Hell is similar to the medieval Christian view of Dante. [citation needed] However, Satan is not viewed as Hell's ruler, merely one of its sufferers. The gate of Hell is guarded by Maalik also known as Zabaaniyah. The Quran states that the fuel of Hellfire is rocks/stones (idols) and human beings. Names of Hell according to Islamic Tradition based on the Quranic ayah and Hadith: Jahim Hutamah Jahannam Ladza Hawiah Saqor Sae'er Sijjin Zamhareer",
            "While the majority of Christianity views Hell as a place of eternal torment, some Christians, such as Universalist Christians (see Universalism ) contend that after resurrection, unrepentant sinners are judged and purified in the lake of fire and then later accepted into Heaven, while others believe that after resurrection, the unrepentant sinners are permanently destroyed in the lake of fire (see annihilationism ).",
            "Heaven will be as created as anything else in the universe. I\u2019m not sure how it will all work out, but it\u2019s certainly worth pondering within scriptural parameters. To that end, let me suggest a template. In 1 Corinthians 15 the apostle Paul addressed the question of what our new bodies will be like in the new creation. He provided us with the following analogy: \u201cSomeone may ask, \u2018How are the dead raised? With what kind of body will they come?\u2019 ... When you sow, you do not plant the body that will be, but just a seed, perhaps of wheat or of something else. But God gives it a body as he has determined, and to each kind of seed he gives its own body\u201d (1 Corinthians 15:35, 37-38).",
            "How will I be happy in heaven knowing someone I love won\u2019t be there? \r Scripture says that \u201cthere will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain\u201d in heaven. The enemies of God will hold no power or leverage over heaven. They may not consent to joy themselves, but they will be powerless to diminish, by even an ounce, the joy of God\u2019s people. In heaven our love and intimacy with God will be such, that we will not experience grief for those who have rejected him. They will feel more like enemies to us, though from the perspective of our rather trivial love for God here, I don\u2019t think we can see it. Do all dogs go to heaven? \r Yes. And eternal rewards for those who have killed cats. Will Satan rule over hell? \r No! God alone rules over hell, showing his rightful dominion as he exerts his wrath. Then comes the end, when [the Son] delivers the kingdom to God the Father after destroying every rule and every authority and power. (1 Corinthians 15:24 ESV) \r Amen.",
            "Eventually, Jewish thinkers began to reason that it didn't make much sense because there were times when they would be doing what God told them to do, or at least they'd be doing their level best to do what God told them to do, and they'd still be suffering these plagues. And that's when they developed the idea that, in fact, it's the forces of evil causing these disasters. These continue to be two of the common explanations today.",
            "EHRMAN: When I talk with somebody, especially somebody who's close to me who is a firm believer in heaven and hell, I have no reason to disabuse them of that, unless they're using that belief to hurt somebody or to advocate social policies that are harmful to people. My dear elderly mother is a very good Christian, and she believes that she will die and she will go to heaven and she will see her husband. And so I would be crazy to say, no, Mom, actually, yeah, you're not going to see him (laughter). Of course, I'm not going to - I mean, there's no reason to shatter somebody's beliefs, especially if they simply are providing them with hope.",
            "The Qur'an also says that some of those who are damned to Hell are not damned forever, but instead for an indefinite period of time. In any case, there is good reason to believe that punishment in Hell is not meant to actually last eternally, but instead serves as a basis for spiritual rectification. Even though in Islam, the devil, or shaytan, is created from fire, he suffers in Hell because Hellfire is 70 times hotter than the fire of this world. It was also said that Shaytan is derived from shata, (literally `burned'), because it was created from a smokeless fire.",
            "That sense we now have with a spouse or a close friend \u201cthat I know this person in a way no one else does\u201d may be how we feel about Jesus in heaven. C. S. Lewis reasons, \u201cWe were all made to fit a place in the divine contour of God. Each of us will know and forever praise an aspect of the divine beauty better than anyone else. If this were not so it seems strange that God would make more souls than one.\u201d 3 The final temple: the holy and eternal dwelling place of God In one of his dialogues, Jesus was primarily talking about his body and his coming crucifixion, but we learn from his words that Jesus understood himself to be the ultimate temple of God\u2019s people: Then the Jews demanded of him, \u201cWhat miraculous sign can you show us to prove your authority to do all this?\u201d Jesus answered them, \u201cDestroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days.\u201d (John 2:18-19)",
            "I like how Lewis describes the effect negation has on our imagination. Our present outlook might be like that of a small boy who, on being told that the sexual act was the highest bodily pleasure should immediately ask whether you ate chocolates at the same time. On receiving the answer \u201cNo\u201d, he might regard absence of chocolates as the chief characteristic of sexuality. In vain would you tell him that the reason why lovers in their carnal raptures don\u2019t bother about chocolates is that they have something better to think of. The boy knows chocolate: he does not know the positive thing that excludes it. 4 It\u2019s true: to think of a future existence as only timeless, painless, sinless, or sexless conjures up the idea of an eternal nap. (\u201cPut your heads down on the desk, kids. Let\u2019s have eternal rest.\u201d) And so negation spray-paints over our glorious hope and arouse fears of our eternal home. Hopefully this survey of biblical teaching on heaven has helped to restore some of that hope.",
            "b. The annihilated-in-hell view. The Scriptures use phrases that underscore hell\u2019s eternal duration: \u201cthe smoke from her goes up for ever and ever\u201d; \u201cfor whom blackest darkness has been reserved forever\u201d; \u201ctheir worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched\u201d (Revelation 19:3; Jude 13; Mark 9:48, emphasis added). Other passages that describe hell\u2019s duration as eternal include these: Matthew 25:46; Mark 9:42-48; 2 Thessalonians 1:9; Jude 6; and Revelation 14:11; 20:10. I recommend that you be suspicious of those who would dismiss or soften hell. After all, the first liespoken by Satan was a denial of God\u2019s judgment. As Eve wondered about the consequence of eating from thefruit of thetree, Satan assured her, \u201cYou will not surely die\u201d (Genesis 3:4). If we were to surrender hell, we would gut the gospel of its truth and its power. And how could a powerless gospel save? Consider this soberly: our reticence to talk about hell could lead to people\u2019s going there.",
            "Similarly, believing heaven to be a visit to your grandmother\u2019s, or believing hell to be a 30\u02da hotter version of spring break, would seriously hinder your pursuit of God in this life. What should meditating on the glory of heaven, along with the horror of hell, do to us? For us as believers, we see at least four ways this should affect our Christian lives. Convention requires me to make these all begin with the same letter. I\u2019ve chosen \u2018H\u2019. Here we go.",

            "EHRMAN: That's a really good question. I probably would have subscribed - I would have subscribed to either the view that God was upset and we needed to repent so that he would relent, or that the devil - it was the devil doing it, and we needed to pray to God for mercy and for him to intervene on our behalf. GROSS: And compare that to now. EHRMAN: Well, I think those views - I mean, I respect believers. I do not try to convert anybody. I don't try to trash anybody's views. I try to respect everybody's views. I think that sometimes those very highly religious views can be socially extremely dangerous because if you think that the cause is supernatural, then you don't have much motivation to find a natural solution. It is quite dangerous to refuse the findings of science because of your personal beliefs. And we all just hope that it doesn't lead to even further disaster.",
            "Though my good works do not save me, they will not be overlooked. \u201cI tell you the truth,\u201d Jesus said, \u201cno one who has left home or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God will fail to receive many times as much in this age and, in the age to come, eternal life\u201d (Luke 18:29-30).

            "There are a number of modern Buddhists, especially among Western schools, who believe that Hell is but a state of mind. In a sense, a bad day at work could be Hell, and a great day at work could be heaven. This has been supported by some modern scholars who advocate the interpretation of such metaphysical portions of the Scriptures symbolically rather than literally.",
            "The image of the city and the wedding are both corporate ones, highlighting the communal nature of heaven. That sounds great, but it could lead us to fear the loss of personal identity: knowing that God loves the world feels different from knowing that God loves me. I think that the Scriptures make a point to assuage this fear and communicate the personal nature of heaven. Such a promise seems to lurk behind this passage: \u201cTo him who overcomes, I will give . . . a white stone with a new name written on it, known only to him who receives it\u201d (Revelation 2:17). A name that only you and Jesus know \u2013 that\u2019s pretty personal (I hope mine\u2019s not Spanky or Weazer).",

            "Obviously the loss of a substantive cash-generating part of its operations means the nominal payout per share will decrease. But investors are uncertain about whether the yield will shrink even faster than the rest of the firm, and have punished 3M as a result of that and other uncertainties.

            "Are these the best dividend stocks? The stocks in the chart may have high yields, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they're the best dividend stocks for any investor. The ideal portfolio varies person to person, based on individual goals and timelines for those goals. Besides, many investors are better off buying index funds rather than individual stocks. A high dividend yield can also indicate many things, and not all of them are good. As stated previously, falling stock prices can increase dividend yields, and some companies go into debt by overspending on their dividend. The over-spenders may eventually be forced to cut their dividends if they become unsustainably expensive.

            "Take Occidental Petroleum ( OXY ), one of Warren Buffett's high dividend stock darlings , as an example. The stock yielded 7.7% going into 2020. Shares of the energy company dropped 50% though, during the year. Additionally, the company slashed its dividend. That left investors with a net loss of more than 50%, even with the remaining paltry 0.2% dividend. Keep in mind, too, companies paying high dividends can cut them when the business wanes. Occidental did that in 2020. Ford ( F ) cut its storied dividend in the first quarter of 2020 to nothing, down from the 15 cents a share it paid previously. Ford's dividend yield was 6.5% in early 2020. It's just 2.6% now. High Dividend Stocks: IBD's Better Approach So, if chasing yield doesn't work, what does? One IBD strategy looks for high-dividend stocks with signs of stability going for them. Specifically, these stocks have: High dividend yields of 3%-plus. That's more than 100% higher than the S&P's 1.3% yield.",
            "2. Evaluate the stock To look under the hood of a high-dividend stock, start by comparing the dividend yields among its peers. If a company\u2019s dividend yield is much higher than that of similar companies, it could be a red flag. At the very least, it\u2019s worth additional research into the company and the safety of the dividend. Then look at the stock\u2019s payout ratio, which tells you how much of the company\u2019s income is going toward dividends. A payout ratio that is too high \u2014 generally above 80%, though it can vary by industry \u2014 means the company is putting a large percentage of its income into paying dividends. In some cases dividend payout ratios can top 100%, meaning the company may be going into debt to pay out dividends. (Read our full guide on how to research stocks .)",

            "Dividend yield = Annual dividend/Stock share price Why does this equation matter? A falling stock can make a dividend yield look great. Let's say you buy a $30-a-share stock that pays $3 a year in dividends. You might be initially thrilled with your impressive 10% annual dividend yield ($3 dividend divided by $30 stock price). The stock's yield is 500% larger than the S&P 500's roughly 1.3% yield. Now, the stock crashes to $15 a share and the company holds the dividend the same. Applying the same dividend yield formula, the stock's dividend yield doubles to 20%. Looks great. But wait a second, despite the higher yield, you're worse off because you lost $15 a share on the stock. It will take five years of $3 dividend payments just to break even on your stock loss .

            "Financial Firm Flexes Its Dividend Power Historically financial firms show why durable earnings coupled with dividend yields can be a powerful combination. Federal Agricultural Mortgage is a case in point. The Washington D.C.-based firm's 3.5% dividend yield calls out to income-seeking investors. But our analysis shows there's more to it than just a market-beating payout. Roughly 16% earnings growth the past five years and 11% earnings growth the past three show the lender to rural and farm markets is tapping new routes of expansion. Most promising is the firm, is committed to dividend growth. Federal Agricultural Mortgage boosted its dividend 26%. All this, and an acceptable IBD Composite Rating of 68 .",

            "Healthpeak Properties Inc. ( PEAK ) Market value: $9 billion Dividend yield: 7.4% Formerly known as HCP, Healthpeak is a REIT, or a real estate investment trust , that is focused on health care properties including outpatient medical, lab space and continuing-care retirement facilities. REITs have a mandate to deliver 90% of taxable income back to shareholders via dividends, and that means generous and reliable dividends as PEAK passes through to investors a portion of the rent paid by its tenants. Still, a rising-interest-rate environment has made real estate firms pay more for the debt they require to grow, and shares are about half of where they were two years ago. Recent performance aside, it's undeniable that we all need care as we age and the built-in customer base of Healthpeak should help provide a measure of reliability over the long haul.",

Keep in mind that if you own these securities in a taxable brokerage account, you\u2019ll need to pay taxes on the income you receive, even if you reinvest those dividends . If you want to avoid taxes, you\u2019ll need to own the shares in a tax-advantaged account such as an IRA or 401(k) . Be sure to research any dividend stocks carefully before investing.

            "Whirlpool Corp. ( WHR ) Market value: $6 billion Dividend yield: 6.5% Like many consumer discretionary names, appliance giant Whirlpool has faced a challenging environment over the last two years thanks to rising input costs, stiff competition and broader economic uncertainty, causing some shoppers to delay pricey purchases. That's reflected in its poor share performance as WHR stock has lost more than half its value since the end of 2021. Still, even as its stock price has slumped, the quarterly dividend remains firm at $1.75 a share. And perhaps most importantly, payouts are only about half of total earnings projected for fiscal year 2024. That means the distributions seem quite safe, even if volatility for shares may be the norm in Whirlpool for a bit longer. The smallest stock on this list, WHR is perhaps one of the most sensitive. But if things go well for Whirlpool in 2024, it could also be the S&P 500 dividend stock that turns around in the most dramatic fashion.",
            "Eight High Dividend Stocks You Can Count On Licensing MATT KRANTZ 12:45 PM ET 04/15/2022 It's easy to chase high dividend stocks \u2014 and even easier to lose money on them if they fall . There's a better way to find high dividend yields you can count on to make you money \u2014 which includes stocks like materials company Rio Tinto ( RIO ) and financials like T. Rowe Price ( TROW ) plus Federal Agricultural Mortgage ( AGM ). X All things held equal, when a stock falls the dividend yield rises. In other words, if you own a company with a massive yield that's rising, you're likely losing money on the underlying stock. That's not a successful long-term strategy. It's actually a common way to lose money. What's an investor looking for high dividend stocks to do then? Find stocks with market-beating yields and shares that at least keep pace with the market long term. That way you get a rich dividend that isn't eroded by a faltering stock price.",

            "The No. 1 consideration in buying a dividend stock is the safety of its dividend. Dividend yields over 4% should be carefully scrutinized; those over 10% tread firmly into risky territory. Among other things, a too-high dividend yield can indicate the payout is unsustainable, or that investors are selling the stock, driving down its share price and increasing the dividend yield as a result. Another thing to keep in mind is that dividends in taxable brokerage accounts cause taxes to be realized in the year the dividends occur, unlike stocks that do not pay dividends whose taxation primarily occurs when the stock is sold. For investors with taxable accounts and in high income brackets, dividends stock might not be as tax efficient as other options. \u00bb Need more detail? Learn how dividends are taxed",

            "What\u2019s dangerous is when a business declines. Dividends are paid out of a company\u2019s cash flows. If the business sees its cash flows decline, or worse is losing money, it may reduce or eliminate its dividend. Business decline is a real risk with high yield investing. Business declines often coincide with and or accelerate during recessions. A company\u2019s payout ratio gives a good gauge of how much \u2018room\u2019 a company has to pay its dividend. The payout ratio is calculated as dividends divided by income. The lower the payout ratio, the better, because dividends have more earnings coverage. A company with a payout ratio over 100% is paying out more in dividends than it is making in profits, a long-term unsustainable situation. A company with a payout ratio of 50% is making double in income what it is paying out in dividends, so it has \u2018room\u2019 for earnings to decline significantly without reducing its dividend.",

What was first known as the American Telegraph and Telephone company got its start way back in 1885, and has evolved with the digital workforce to include data and wireless connections. It also dabbled in media until a restructuring a few years ago, when it spun out its stake in Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. ( WBD ). Since then, the core business of AT&T has been focused on data connectivity and shoring up its balance sheet. The proof is in recent fundamentals, including $16.8 billion in free cash flow in 2023 \u2013 up from $14.2 billion in 2022 \u2013 and roughly $3 billion in debt reduction last year.

            "The Risks Of High-Yield Investing Investing in high-yield stocks is a great way to generate income. But it is not without risks. First,\u00a0 stock prices fluctuate . Investors need to understand their risk tolerance before investing in high dividend stocks. Share price fluctuations means that your investment can (and almost certainly will) decline in value, at least temporarily (and possibly permanently) do to market volatility. Second,\u00a0 businesses grow and decline . Investing in a stock gives you fractional ownership in the underlying business. Some businesses grow over time. These businesses are likely to pay\u00a0 higher dividends over time . The Dividend Champions are an excellent example of this; each has paid rising dividends for 25+ consecutive years.",

            "01 of 18 What Types of Dog Breeds Live the Longest? Jerry Klein, DVM, is the chief veterinary officer of the American Kennel Club . He says research indicates larger dogs' lifespan is approximately 7\u201310 years, and smaller dogs have a life expectancy of 13\u201316 years. \"Breeds in the toy group , some of the terriers, and Australian cattle dogs have been known to live long lives,\" Klein says.\"But the longest-lived dog I've personally ever met was a Schipperke \u2014a small dog breed that originated in Belgium\u2014who was 23.\"",
            "Factors influencing the dog\u2019s longevity Size and genetics In general, the smallest the dogs, the longer their lifespan . The majority of the longest-living dogs are small breeds , and they can live up to 16 years or even more . In comparison, a medium dog\u2019s average age is between 10 and 13 years, while giant dog breeds are usually not living more than 8 years. Apart from the size, genetics play a huge role in the dog\u2019s lifespan, making some breeds live much longer than others. Lifestyle Genetics and general breed\u2019s predisposition to live long is one thing, but a good and healthy lifestyle is also a crucial ingredient to longevity . Make sure to provide your dog with a high-quality diet, the proper amount of physical and mental stimulation adjusted to the dog\u2019s needs, and never neglect visit to the veterinary for regular check-ups and in case of health problems. By ensuring healthy living conditions for your dog, you can maximise their lifespan.",
            "18 of 18 Fluffy Long-Living Dog: Samoyed Lthi Kay Canthr Caeng / EyeEm / Getty Okay, maybe a Samoyed isn't the absolute floofiest, but for this list, he ranks pretty high! If you don't mind regular grooming and furry dust bunnies floating around for 12\u201314 years, the trade-offs make it all worth it, as this double-coated dog breed is full of charm, personality, and more than a little zest. Their Nordic sled-dog heritage means they appreciate two things: a job to do and their people. And maybe a blast of cold weather ! Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback! Tell us why!

            "Maltese This small breed will not only be in your life for long years, but it will also be a very affectionate lap dog that might suffer from separation anxiety if left alone for too long. Apart from their snuggling nature, the Maltese is also playful and easily trainable . Interestingly, female Maltese tend to live one year longer than males, but the average lifespan of the breed is 15 years. Jack Russel Terrier Originally bred as a working dog , the Jack Russel Terrier still has the energy and concentration that they needed in the past. For this reason, this breed needs a lot of exercise and an owner that will keep up with the dog\u2019s fast life pace. Because of their independence that sometimes makes them difficult to train, Jack Russel Terriers are recommended for experienced dog owners . The longest living representative of the breed and the holder of a Guinness World Record, Willie, was 20 years old, but the breed lives up to 18 years on average.",

Apart from their cuteness, Llhasa Apso dogs are also confident, loyal, and playful , but they are also rather suspicious of strangers , which makes them great watch dogs. They live on average up to 15 years, however, the oldest known representative of the breed died in 1939 at the astonishing age of 29 years. Cockapoo This hybrid breed takes the best traits from their parent breeds, Cocker Spaniel and Poodle.

The oldest living dachshund, Chanel, died in 2009 at the age of 21 years old. If it comes to their personality, Dachshunds are a very playful and devoted breed. Toy Poodle This small version of a Poodle is as intelligent and energetic as their big cousin. They are perfect for families, but they need a lot of mental and physical stimulation .

            "The list of 12 dog breeds with the longest lifespan Chihuahua At the very top of the list of the longest-living dog breeds, this curious and bright dog from the Toy Group can live even more than 20 years , although the average life expectancy of the breed is around 16 years. Chihuahuas are not prone to serious genetic illnesses, but they may suffer from some heart and eye conditions . Despite their tiny size, they need a lot of both mental and physical stimulation as well as training, necessary to avoid some behavioural problems and to socialise the dog. Chihuahuas are also very loyal companions. Yorkshire Terrier Also known as Yorkies, this breed is popular and intelligent , but not completely a lap dog like some other members of the Toy Group. This is due to the terrier traits that include strong guarding instincts . Their playful personality is one side, but they are also highly trainable, and can live up to 16 years.",
            "Klein adds that longevity, while primarily determined by genetics, is also impacted by lifestyle choices that influence how a dog (or a person) is \"hardwired.\" \"Wellness care is often extremely important for a quality, longer life,\" Klein says. \"By receiving an appropriate high-quality diet , getting proper and regular physical activity and mental stimulation, and with you adhering to the veterinary recommendations for annual or semi-annual wellness exams , your dog will be more primed to live a longer and healthier life.\" If you're also wondering about the shortest- and longest-living dog breeds, keep in mind that size can make a difference, too. The gentle Bernese mountain dog , usually between 60\u2013110 pounds, lives an average of seven years, while the feisty Chihuahua , who weighs about 3\u20136 pounds, might be your pal for up to 18 years. 02 of 18 Smallest Long-Living Dog Breed: Yorkshire Terrier (Yorkie) Christina B\u00f8rding / Getty",

            "What Are the Biggest Companies in the World by Revenue? While many people are interested in ranking companies by market value or market cap, the top companies by revenue differ somewhat. This could be because they are more capital-intensive and have lower profit margins. It could also mean that they are more mature companies with fewer growth prospects. The top five companies by annual revenue as of Q1 2024, are: Walmart (WMT): $608.79 billion Saudi Aramco (2222.SR): $501.65 billion Amazon (AMZN): $554.03 billion Sinopec (600028.SS): $473.5 billion PetroChina (601857.SS) $435.3 billion",

With more than $600 billion in annual revenue, it earns more than most of the other companies on this list by a wide margin.",
            "What Is the Biggest Company on Each Continent? The largest company by market cap on each continent as of Q1 2024 (excluding Antarctica) are as follows: North America - Microsoft (MSFT): $3.0 trillion South America - Petrobras (PBR): $105.0 billion Europe - Novo Norodisk (NVO): $478.4 billion Asia - Saudi Aramco (2222.SR): $2.06 trillion Africa - Naspers (NPN.JO): $29.3 billion Australia - BHP Group (BHP): $155.7 billion The Bottom Line The biggest companies in the world today are worth several trillion dollars. This makes these companies larger and more valuable than some countries' entire economies. Today, tech and energy companies dominate the biggest corporations in the world. In the past, trading companies, railroads, and steelworks dominated. Time will tell if these high flyers can stay in the top positions and which industries emerge to challenge these coveted positions.",
            "Microsoft, Apple, and Saudi Aramco are the biggest companies measured by market cap. By Lyle Daly \u2013 Updated Feb 2, 2024 at 11:24AM After a strong start to 2024, Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) is the most valuable company in the world. It passed longtime rival Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) in January, when it also became just the second company to reach a market capitalization of $3 million. Seven of the largest companies have a market cap of at least $1 trillion. Image source: Getty Images. While tech companies dominate the top of the stock market , there are other sectors represented, including oil , insurance, medical companies , payment networks, and luxury brands . Read on to see the 20 biggest companies and where they stand as of February 2024.",
            "Key findings Microsoft is the largest company in the world, with a market cap of $2.95 trillion. It's followed by Apple ($2.85 trillion), Saudi Arabian Oil ($2.00 trillion), Alphabet ($1.77 trillion), and Amazon ($1.60 trillion). Tech companies have been growing rapidly. Seven of the 10 largest companies are in the sector, and they've all outpaced the S&P 500 over the past five years. There are only four non-U.S. companies in the top 20: Saudi Arabian Oil, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Novo Nordisk, and LVMH.",
            "Market Cap Definition: Market cap (i.e. market capitalization) is the total market value of the company\u2019s outstanding shares. To calculate a company\u2019s market cap, you simply take the current stock price and multiply it by the total number of shares outstanding. For example, if Apple ( AAPL ) had 4.4 billion shares outstanding and its stock price was $318.18 per share, Apple\u2019s market cap would be $1.4 trillion (4,400,000,000 times $318.18). Market cap is often used by investors to obtain a quick estimate of a company\u2019s overall value. Investors will often use market capitalization as one factor in determining a prospective stock purchase. For example, an institutional investor may want to limit their stock purchases to companies with a market capitalization greater than $5 billion in order to ensure sufficient liquidity. Stocks are often categorized by market cap: mega-cap ($100 billion plus), large-cap ($10 billion-$100 billion), mid-cap ($2 billion-$10 billion), small-cap ($300",
            "Key Takeaways Company value is often measured by market capitalization or the value of all shares in the market. Microsoft, Apple, and Saudi Aramco are the top three global companies, each with market caps of over $2 trillion each. Technology and energy companies rank among the most valuable companies in the world today. U.S.-based companies fill most top slots. 1.

            "Takeaways Takeaways for investors Large-cap stocks like these are an important part of every investor's portfolio. They generally provide more safety and stability than smaller stocks since most of them are established companies with strong brands. They can be highly profitable as well; 16 of the stocks on this list outperformed the S&P 500 over the past five years. Tech companies, in particular, can often be profitable investments. They make up four of the top five -- and seven of the top 10 -- largest companies by market cap. Yet even with the biggest companies in the world, no investment is a sure thing. A diversified portfolio is still a must so that you're not overly reliant on any single company or market sector. Sources JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Most companies in the top-10 list generate hundreds of billions of dollars in annual revenue. However, there are a few that generate less than $100 billion in annual revenue, suggesting that investors are optimistic about the potential growth of these companies compared with others on the list.

[14] In 1996, the company's record label, DreamWorks Records , was founded, the first project of which was George Michael 's album Older . The first band signed to the label was eels , who released their debut album Beautiful Freak that year. The record company never lived up to expectations, though, and was sold in October 2003 to Universal Music Group , which operated the label as DreamWorks Nashville . That label was shut down in 2005 when its flagship artist, Toby Keith , departed to form his own label. [15]",

            "In 2000, DreamWorks was planning on building a studio backlot after buying 1,087 acres of land in the Playa Vista area in Los Angeles. It was to be complete with 18 sound stages , with many office buildings and a lake. There would also be new homes, schools, churches, and museums. The project was to be completed in 2001, but was cancelled for financial reasons. [18] Starting in 1999, DreamWorks won three consecutive Academy Awards for Best Picture for American Beauty , Gladiator and A Beautiful Mind (the latter two were co-productions with Universal Pictures). DreamWorks became the first new major Hollywood motion picture studio since RKO Pictures was founded in 1928, that same year, Go Fish Pictures , a division of DreamWorks with the objective to distribute art-house , independent and foreign films, was founded. The division experienced success with the anime films Millennium Actress (2003) and Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence (2004), respectively,",
            "films Millennium Actress (2003) and Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence (2004), respectively, which led them to venture into releasing live-action films, with the release of The Chumscrubber . However, The Chumscrubber was a commercial and critical failure, which led DreamWorks to shut down the division in 2007 shortly after the release of the Japanese film Casshern .

[28] Several public equity funds were approached for financing, including Blackstone Group , Fuse Global, TPG Capital and several others, but all passed on the deal given their understanding of the Hollywood markets. On September 22, 2008, it was announced that DreamWorks closed a deal with Indian investment firm Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group to create a $1.2 billion stand-alone production company and end its ties with Paramount. [2] In January 2009, Spielberg entered a licensing agreement with DreamWorks Animation to use the DreamWorks trademarks, logo, and name for film productions and releases. [29]",

            "In 2000, DreamWorks was planning on building a studio backlot after buying 1,087 acres of land in the Playa Vista area in Los Angeles. It was to be complete with 18 sound stages , with many office buildings and a lake. There would also be new homes, schools, churches, and museums. The project was to be completed in 2001, but was cancelled for financial reasons. [18] Starting in 1999, DreamWorks won three consecutive Academy Awards for Best Picture for American Beauty , Gladiator and A Beautiful Mind (the latter two were co-productions with Universal Pictures). DreamWorks became the first new major Hollywood motion picture studio since RKO Pictures was founded in 1928, that same year, Go Fish Pictures , a division of DreamWorks with the objective to distribute art-house , independent and foreign films, was founded. The division experienced success with the anime films Millennium Actress (2003) and Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence (2004), respectively,",

[25] The film library was valued at $900 million. Paramount Pictures retained the worldwide distribution rights to those films, as well as various ancillary rights, including music publishing (the music publishing rights were later licensed to Sony/ATV Music Publishing when the company acquired Viacom's Famous Music subdivision), sequels and merchandising. The sale was completed on May 8, 2006. [26] On February 8, 2010, Viacom repurchased Soros' controlling stake in the DreamWorks Pictures library for around $400 million. [27]",
            "Reliance-Spielberg joint venture [ edit ] In June 2008, it reported that DreamWorks was looking for financing that would allow it to continue operations, but as an independent production company, once its deal with Paramount ended later that year. [28] Several public equity funds were approached for financing, including Blackstone Group , Fuse Global, TPG Capital and several others, but all passed on the deal given their understanding of the Hollywood markets. On September 22, 2008, it was announced that DreamWorks closed a deal with Indian investment firm Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group to create a $1.2 billion stand-alone production company and end its ties with Paramount. [2] In January 2009, Spielberg entered a licensing agreement with DreamWorks Animation to use the DreamWorks trademarks, logo, and name for film productions and releases. [29]",

            "In 2000, DreamWorks was planning on building a studio backlot after buying 1,087 acres of land in the Playa Vista area in Los Angeles. It was to be complete with 18 sound stages , with many office buildings and a lake. There would also be new homes, schools, churches, and museums. The project was to be completed in 2001, but was cancelled for financial reasons. [18] Starting in 1999, DreamWorks won three consecutive Academy Awards for Best Picture for American Beauty , Gladiator and A Beautiful Mind (the latter two were co-productions with Universal Pictures). DreamWorks became the first new major Hollywood motion picture studio since RKO Pictures was founded in 1928, that same year, Go Fish Pictures , a division of DreamWorks with the objective to distribute art-house , independent and foreign films, was founded. The division experienced success with the anime films Millennium Actress (2003) and Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence (2004), respectively,",
