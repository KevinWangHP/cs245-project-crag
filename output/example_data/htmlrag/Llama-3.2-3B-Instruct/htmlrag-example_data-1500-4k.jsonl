Hades, literally meaning unseen, usually refers to the state of death, which is defined by some as a conscious waiting place for resurrection, and by others as a state of unconsciousness synonymous with death itself. Gehenna, on the other hand, more ambiguous than hades, seems to refer to judgment and fits more closely with the modern conceptions of Hell. Tartarus is used in reference to the judgment of sinning angels and seems to be an allusion to Greek mythology (see <a>Tartarus</a>).\nWhile the majority of Christianity views Hell as a place of eternal torment, some Christians, such as Universalist Christians (see <a>Universalism</a>) contend that after resurrection, unrepentant sinners are judged and purified in the lake of fire and then later accepted into Heaven, while others believe that after resurrection, the unrepentant sinners are permanently destroyed in the lake of fire (see <a>annihilationism</a>).\nVarious interpretations of the torments of Hell exist, ranging from fiery pits of wailing sinners to lonely isolation from God's presence. However, the descriptions of Hell found in the Bible are quite vague. The books of Matthew, Mark, and Jude tell of a place of fire, while the books of Luke and Revelation report it as an abyss. Our modern, more graphic, images of Hell have developed from writings that are not found in the Bible. Dante's <a>The Divine Comedy</a> is a classic inspiration for modern images of Hell. Other early Christian writings also illustrate the anguish of Hell. Most Christians believe that damnation occurs immediately upon death (<a>particular judgment</a>), and others that it occurs after <a>Judgment Day</a>, which is written about in the book of <a>Revelation</a>. \n</p4>\n<div5>\n<p>Share this comparison via: \n</p>\n<p>If you read this far, you should follow us:\n</p>\n<p>\"Heaven vs Hell.\" <i>Diffen.com.</i> Diffen LLC, n.d.

For example, historically the total annual return (which includes dividends) of the S&amp;P 500 has been, on average, about two percentage points higher than the index's annual change in value.</span><p><span>And that difference can really add up. Using NerdWallet\u2019s </span><span>investment calculator</span><span>, we can see that a $5,000 investment that grows at 6% annually for 20 years could grow to over $16,000. Bump that up to 8% growth to include dividends, and that $5,000 could grow to over $24,000.</span></p><span>In general, a good rule of thumb is to invest the bulk of your portfolio in index funds, for the above reasons. But investing in individual dividend stocks directly has benefits.</span><p><span>\u00bb Looking for stability in your portfolio?</span><span> Consider </span><span>TIPS to combat inflation</span></p><span>Although it requires more work on the part of the investor \u2014 in the form of research into each stock to ensure it fits into your overall portfolio \u2014 investors who choose individual dividend stocks are able to build a custom portfolio that may offer a higher yield than a dividend fund. Expenses can also be lower with dividend stocks, as ETFs and index funds charge an annual fee, called an expense ratio, to investors.</span><span><span>\u00bb Learn more about </span><span>dividend ETFs</span></span><span>How to invest in dividend stocks</span><span>Building a portfolio of individual dividend stocks takes time and effort, but for many investors it's worth it. Here\u2019s how to buy a dividend stock:</span><span>1. Find a dividend-paying stock</span><span>You can screen for stocks that pay dividends on many financial sites, as well as on your online broker's website. We've also included a list of high-dividend stocks below.</span><span>If you're not quite ready to put your hard-earned money on the line, you can always try paper trading first. Paper trading allows you to practice investing with fake money.</span><p><span>\u00bb Want some practice first?</span><span> Try </span><span>paper trading</span></p><span>2. Evaluate the stock</span><span>To look under the hood of a high-dividend stock, start by comparing the dividend yields among its peers. If a company\u2019s dividend yield is much higher than that of similar companies, it could be a red flag. At the very least, it\u2019s worth additional research into the company and the safety of the dividend.</span><p><span>Then look at the stock\u2019s payout ratio, which tells you how much of the company\u2019s income is going toward dividends. A payout ratio that is too high \u2014 generally above 80%, though it can vary by industry \u2014 means the company is putting a large percentage of its income into paying dividends. In some cases dividend payout ratios can top 100%, meaning the company may be going into debt to pay out dividends. (Read our full guide on how to </span><span>research stocks</span><span>.)</span></p><span>3. Decide how much stock you want to buy</span><p><span>You need diversification if you\u2019re buying individual stocks, so you\u2019ll need to determine what percent of your portfolio goes into each stock. For example, you\u2019re buying 20 stocks, you could put 5% of your portfolio in each. However, if the stock is riskier, you might want to buy less of it and put more of your money toward safer choices. If you're going to reinvest your dividends, you'll need to </span><span>recalculate your cost basis</span><span> \u2014 the amount you originally paid to purchase the stock.</span></p><span>The No. 1 consideration in buying a dividend stock is the safety of its dividend. Dividend yields over 4% should be carefully scrutinized; those over 10% tread firmly into risky territory. Among other things, a too-high dividend yield can indicate the payout is unsustainable, or that investors are selling the stock, driving down its share price and increasing the dividend yield as a result.</span><span>Another thing to keep in mind is that dividends in taxable brokerage accounts cause taxes to be realized in the year the dividends occur, unlike stocks that do not pay dividends whose taxation primarily occurs when the stock is sold. For investors with taxable accounts and in high income brackets, dividends stock might not be as tax efficient as other options.</span><p><span>\u00bb Need more detail?</span><span> Learn</span><span> how dividends are taxed</span></p><span>Are these the best dividend stocks?</span><span>The stocks in the chart may have high yields, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they're the best dividend stocks for any investor. The ideal portfolio varies person to person, based on individual goals and timelines for those goals. Besides, many investors are better off buying index funds rather than individual stocks.</span><span>A high dividend yield can also indicate many things, and not all of them are good. As stated previously, falling stock prices can increase dividend yields, and some companies go into debt by overspending on their dividend. The over-spenders may eventually be forced to cut their dividends if they become unsustainably expensive.</span><p><span>If you're looking for dividend stocks with a low risk of cutting their dividends, check out the </span><span>dividend aristocrats</span><span> \u2014 a group of S&amp;P 500 stocks that have increased their dividends every year for at least 25 years.</span></p><div><span>Track your finances all in one place</span><span>Find ways to save more by tracking your income and net worth on NerdWallet.</span><span>Sign Up</span></div><p><span>\u00bb </span><span>Dive deeper:</span><span> Learn </span><span>how to buy stocks</span></p><span>Neither the author nor editor held positions in the aforementioned investments at the time of publication.</span></div></div>"

Should it ever happen, these are the actors we want in the Invincible Live Action movie.</p>\n<h2>Mark Grayson \u2013 Ryan Potter</h2>\n<div> Featured Video </div>\n<div> Advertisement</div>\n<p>The titular character of the series is of mixed race. Mark Grayson\u2019s mother is Asian American. So don\u2019t start blowing horns. Ryan Potter is best known for voicing Hiro Hamada in Big Hero 6. He may not be a widely well-known actor but he has the skills and the look to pull this off. Mark Grayson starts out as a teenager, which just so happens to be the age bracket of Potter.</p>\n<strong>You May Also Like: <a>10 Reasons Why Invincible (&amp; Not Falcon And Winter Soldier) Is 2021\u2019s Greatest Superhero Show</a></strong>\n<h2>Omni-Man \u2013 Joe Manganiello</h2>\n<div> Advertisement</div>\n<p>People might be furious as to why we did not pick Javier Bardem or John Hamm for the role. while both are terrific actors, playing Omni-Man requires an actor who is a seasoned veteran in playing the mysterious, violent vigilante. Joe Manganiello has the experience and the acting chops to play Omni-Man. He has already played a comic book character \u2013 Deathstroke. And who else do you think could pull off the role of a Family Man with the body of a Greek God?</p>\n<h2>Deborah Grayson \u2013 Lucy Liu</h2>\n<p>Lucy Liu is a seasoned actor in the film industry. Deborah Grayson is not actually portrayed as a character of Asian descent in the first seven issues. But the fans have seen her as such. Considering an Asian-American actor voices her in the series and Mark is also considered to have Asian ancestry, Lucy Liu is the perfect choice. She is known to play powerful female characters on screen like Watson in Elementary and her role in Charlie\u2019s Angels.</p>\n<h2>Atom Eve \u2013 Katherine Langford</h2>\n<div> Advertisement</div>\n<p>It was a close call between Bella Thorne, Emma Stone, and Katherine Langford. Emma was too old to play Atom Eve. Between Bella Thorne and Katherine Langford, we believe the latter is a better choice. Her roles in 13 Reasons Why and Cursed have shown she plays charactersgoing through internal conflict really well.</p>\n<h2>Allen the Alien \u2013 Alan Tudyk</h2>\n<div> Advertisement</div>\n<p>There were some fan circles that said the best choice for an actor to portray Allen the Alien is seth Rogen. But we believe it is Alan Tudyk. Allen the Alien, in the Invincible Universe, is the last of his race, genetically designed to fight the mighty Viltrumites. he is smart, funny, clueless, and innocent as a bee at times. Alan Tudyk would require some CGI to buff up his musculature though. But the eccentricities of the character could not be played better by anyone other than Tudyk.</p>\n<h2>Mauler Twins \u2013 Terry Crews</h2>\n<p>The Mauler Twins are one of the first villains Invincible fought and defeated. ironically they are not actually twins. They are clones. But it is hard to find out which one is the clone so they always bicker amongst themselves as to who came first. The Twins wield some heavy scientific knowledge. Terry Crews could play both the Mauler Twins in a live action series. he has the phsycique and the comic timing to create the perfect Mauler Twins impression.</p>\n<h2>Amber &amp; William \u2013 Zendaya &amp; Cameron Monaghan</h2>\n<div> Advertisement</div>\n<p>They may be side characters but they still play a major role in the character development of Invincible as a superhero. Amber is Mark\u2019s first girlfriend who ends up breaking up with him when she finds out Mark is keeping secrets from her. William is Mark\u2019s best friend. He is also gay. Cameron Monaghan of Gotham comes to mind.</p>\n<h2>Cecil Stedman \u2013 Walton Goggins</h2>\n<div> Advertisement</div>\n<p>Cecil Stadman is like the Nick Fury of the Invincible Universe. His job is to keep things together. Like Nick Fury is the Director of SHIELD, Cecil Stedman heads the Global defense Agency. He is also the guy the Guardians of the Globe and Omni-Man answer to. Walton Goggins actually voices the character in the series. He even looks the part. It is only natural he takes up the live action role of the character as well.</p>\n<h2>Thragg \u2013 The Rock</h2>\n<p>Thragg is the Supreme Ruler of the Viltrumite Empire. He is the most powerful Viltrumite to ever exist. No one in the known universe, not even Omni-Man, could defeat Thragg in his absolute prime. He is also the big bad wolf of the Invincible Universe. A character of such stature should only be played by an actor of equal caliber. The Rock, who also plays a character with a similar set of powers in the DCEU \u2013 Black Adam, would be perfect to portray Thragg.</p>\n<h2>Rex Splode &amp; Dupli-Kate \u2013 Tyler Posey &amp; Awkwafina</h2>\n<div> Advertisement</div>\n<p>Rex Splode is of Latinx descent. A brash and arrogant man, Rex was experimented on by his country as a child. He would later gain the ability to charge inorganic matter with explosive energy.\u00a0 Tyler Posey of Teen wolf fame, who boasts of a Latinx heritage, is our choice for Rex Splode. Awkwafina has recently made her presence felt in many Blockbuster movies like Jumanji: Welcome To The Jungle and Shang-Chi. She fits into the roel of Dupli-Kate, a girl with the ability to create multiple clones of herself.</p>\n<h2>Robot &amp; Monster Girl \u2013 Paul Bettany &amp; Millie Bobbie Brown</h2>\n<div> Advertisement</div>\n<p>Robot is basically going to be a voice actor since the android has to be brought to life using CGI. An actor who has already lent his voice for an A.I in another comic book inspired movie universe would be a perfect choice. Paul Bettany voiced JARVIS and then Vision in the MCU. He can nail the role of robot. The girl full of sass and wit, Monster Girl has the power to turn into a literal monster. But every time she turns, her human form grows a bit younger. That\u2019s her curse. Millie Bobbie Brown is young enough to portray Monster Girl in this movie.</p>\n<strong>Also Read: <a>Invincible: Strongest Villains Yet To Appear In The Show</a></strong>\n<h2>The Immortal \u2013 Jeffrey Dean Morgan</h2>\n<div> Advertisement</div>\n<p>The Immortal is based on a DC Comics character named Vandal Savage. Like Savage, the Immortal was once a man who loved in pre-historic times. A mysterious event made him immortal and gave him super powers. The Immortal has been a part of almost all major events of human history. He also\u00a0 leads the Guardians of the Globe. After Omni-Man murders the team, the Immortal returns to life and goes full berserk. Our pick is Jeffrey Dean Morgan. If his role in The Walking Dead as Negan is any indication, he could play deranged characters pretty well.</p>\n</div>\n<noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a>comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript>\n</div>\n<span><a>Amazon</a><a>amazon originals</a><a>Amazon Prime</a><a>Amazon Prime Video</a><a>Amazon Studios</a><a>comic</a><a>image comics</a><a>invincible</a></span>\n<div>\n<h2>Written by <span>Bibhu Prasad Panda</span></h2>\n<div>\nArticles Published: 1230</div>\n<p>With a Bachelor's in Engineering and a Master's in Marketing and Operations, Bibhu found a love for writing, working for many different websites.
