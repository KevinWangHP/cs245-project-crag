Let\u2019s say that: <strong>1.</strong> Office was Installed in English and then; <strong>2.</strong> a Russian accessory pack was installed and then; <strong>3.</strong> the English version was uninstalled. Currently the version of Office is Russian only. Given you have a setup of let\u2019s say Project in Russian, it can be installed:</p><strong>ru_project_professional_2019_x86_x64_dvd_d8a4bf9b.iso)</strong><p>For as long as only one language of Office is installed, it is possible to setup additional Office applications of the same language, regardless of which language is it.</p><strong>Installing Office in Russian</strong><h2>Where Can Additional Office Languages Be Found?</h2><p>Additional languages can be downloaded directly from Microsoft for free from the following link. Currently Office 2010, 2013, 2016 and 2019 are supported: <a>https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=614981</a></p><strong>Downloading Additional Languages for Office Directly from Microsoft, for Free</strong><h2>Are Office 2016 &amp; Office 2019 the same? What\u2019s new in Office 2019?</h2><p>The licensing agreement is more limiting in Office 2019, and it is slower compared with Office 2016 and 2013. Office 2019 also requires Windows 10 1809, and cannot run on Windows 7, for example.</p><h2>New capabilities of Office 2019 include:</h2><p><strong>Word 2019</strong>: Black Theme, LaTeX equation support and text-to-speech features.</p><p><strong>Excel 2019 </strong>provides the ability to publish Excel to PowerBI, enhancements with PowerPivot and PowerQuery as well as new functions such as TEXTJOIN, CONCAT, IFS.</p><p><strong>Powerpoint 2019</strong>: Zoom allows you to go from any slide to another</p><p><strong>Additional features </strong>include Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) which can be inserted to Word, Excel and Powerpoint 2019.</p><p><strong>Access 2019 </strong>offers 11 new charts</p><p><strong>Visio 2019 </strong>offers new website templates</p><p><strong>Accessibility features </strong>have been improved as well, which applies to Word 2019, Excel 2019, Powerpoint 2019 and Outlook 2019.</p><p>Overall it would be difficult to say that Office 2019 has reinvented itself. It rather seems difficult to justify upgrading to Office 2019 with its limited set of new features.</p><p>Microsoft made a list of new features of Office 2019 <a>here</a>.</p><p><strong>In summary</strong>, Office 2019 seems to offer only marginal improvements over Office Professional Plus 2016. We are well aware of users whom continue to work with Microsoft Office 2007 Professional, and are fairly content. We cannot recommend upgrading to Office 2019, though happy to help you install it if you come across the 30182\u20131 (2) error message :)</p><h1>Thank You!</h1><p><strong>Invitation: </strong>Come to our blog @ <strong>Startups Israel</strong>, where you can read reviews of <a>top startup companies</a>, learn <a>how to raise money from investors</a>, <a>the idea of market validation</a>, <a>are startup stock options any good?</a>, and beyond\u2026</p></div2>"

But while the typical stock in the S&amp;P 500 yields only about 1.6% at present, the highest-yielding S&amp;P 500 dividend stocks all deliver yields north of 6% \u2013 roughly four times the typical large U.S. company.

In fact, if you were impressed by AT&amp;T's cash flow, then the even larger $18.7 billion put up by VZ in 2023 will be music to your ears. This is an incredibly strong position for the company, allowing it to comfortably service its debt and continue paying generous dividends to shareholders.</p14><p17>Altria is a popular dividend stock that has been atop the list of the highest-paying S&amp;P 500 dividend stocks for a while. That's because of its consistent and reliable yield and a great track record of increases in its payouts. Specifically, the stock has logged 55 consecutive years of dividend increases \u2013 longer than many other dividend stocks have even been in operation. Of course, growth is challenged for this tobacco giant that produces Marlboro cigarettes, Black &amp; Mild pipe and cigar products, and smokeless tobacco like Copenhagen and Skoal. But it has stable operations and dominates the U.S. market for those who are looking for a nicotine fix.

Mark Grayson\u2019s mother is Asian American. So don\u2019t start blowing horns. Ryan Potter is best known for voicing Hiro Hamada in Big Hero 6. He may not be a widely well-known actor but he has the skills and the look to pull this off. Mark Grayson starts out as a teenager, which just so happens to be the age bracket of Potter.</p1>\n<p2>People might be furious as to why we did not pick Javier Bardem or John Hamm for the role. while both are terrific actors, playing Omni-Man requires an actor who is a seasoned veteran in playing the mysterious, violent vigilante. Joe Manganiello has the experience and the acting chops to play Omni-Man. He has already played a comic book character \u2013 Deathstroke. And who else do you think could pull off the role of a Family Man with the body of a Greek God?</p2>\n<p5>There were some fan circles that said the best choice for an actor to portray Allen the Alien is seth Rogen. But we believe it is Alan Tudyk. Allen the Alien, in the Invincible Universe, is the last of his race, genetically designed to fight the mighty Viltrumites. he is smart, funny, clueless, and innocent as a bee at times. Alan Tudyk would require some CGI to buff up his musculature though. But the eccentricities of the character could not be played better by anyone other than Tudyk.</p5>\n<p6>The Mauler Twins are one of the first villains Invincible fought and defeated. ironically they are not actually twins. They are clones. But it is hard to find out which one is the clone so they always bicker amongst themselves as to who came first. The Twins wield some heavy scientific knowledge. Terry Crews could play both the Mauler Twins in a live action series. he has the phsycique and the comic timing to create the perfect Mauler Twins impression.</p6>\n<p8>Cecil Stadman is like the Nick Fury of the Invincible Universe. His job is to keep things together. Like Nick Fury is the Director of SHIELD, Cecil Stedman heads the Global defense Agency. He is also the guy the Guardians of the Globe and Omni-Man answer to. Walton Goggins actually voices the character in the series. He even looks the part. It is only natural he takes up the live action role of the character as well.</p8>\n<p11>Robot is basically going to be a voice actor since the android has to be brought to life using CGI. An actor who has already lent his voice for an A.I in another comic book inspired movie universe would be a perfect choice. Paul Bettany voiced JARVIS and then Vision in the MCU. He can nail the role of robot. The girl full of sass and wit, Monster Girl has the power to turn into a literal monster. But every time she turns, her human form grows a bit younger. That\u2019s her curse. Millie Bobbie Brown is young enough to portray Monster Girl in this movie.</p11>\n<p12>The Immortal is based on a DC Comics character named Vandal Savage. Like Savage, the Immortal was once a man who loved in pre-historic times. A mysterious event made him immortal and gave him super powers. The Immortal has been a part of almost all major events of human history. He also\u00a0 leads the Guardians of the Globe. After Omni-Man murders the team, the Immortal returns to life and goes full berserk. Our pick is Jeffrey Dean Morgan. If his role in The Walking Dead as Negan is any indication, he could play deranged characters pretty well.</p12>\n</div2>\n</div0>\n</div0>\n</html0>\n<html1>\n<title>10 Actors Who Have Played A Comic Book Character In Both Live-Action &amp; Animation</title>\n<article>\n<header>\n<ul>\n<a>Home</a>\n<a>Movies</a>\n<a>Movie Lists</a>\n</ul>\n<h1>10 Actors Who Have Played A Comic Book Character In Both Live-Action &amp; Animation</h1>\n<div>\n<div>\n<span>By</span>\n<a> David Caballero\n                                                        </a>\n</div>\n<time>Published Jun 10, 2021</time>\n</div>\n<p>Comic book adaptations have taken over film and television, but what famous actors have played a comic book character in live-action and animation?</p>\n</header>\n<div> <p0>The recent release of <em>Invincible</em>\u00a0showcases Oscar winner J.K. Simmons' versatility. He stars as the voice of Omni-Man, <a>a Superman-like hero with a much darker side</a>. Simmons is, of course, no stranger to comic book characters, having played J. Jonah Jameson in Sam Raimi's trilogy of\u00a0<em>Spider-Man</em> movies, as well as Commissioner Gordon in the DCEU's\u00a0<em>Justice League</em>.</p0>\n<p1>The 2000s have been the Golden Age of Superheroes, no doubt. And with so much content in movies and television, it's logical that <a>some actors pull double duty</a>. Over the years, and much like Simmons, many actors have voiced animated versions of superhero characters while also participating in live-action projects.</p1>\n<p2>Academy Award winner J.K. Simmons rose to prominence with roles in\u00a0<em>Law and Order</em> and\u00a0<em>Oz</em>. In 2002, he began playing the role of J. Jonah Jameson in <a>Sam Raimi's trilogy of\u00a0<em>Spider-Man</em> films</a>, which elevated his profile further. In 2015, he won the Oscar for his supporting performance in Damien Chazelle's\u00a0<em>Whiplash</em>.</p2>\n<p6>Two-time Oscar winner Mahershala Ali had a stratospheric rise to stardom in the second half of the 2010s. He won his first Oscar for his performance in 2016's\u00a0<em>Moonlight</em>. In 2018, he voiced Aaron Davis, AKA, Prowler in the critically acclaimed, Oscar-winning movie\u00a0<em>Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse</em>, and won his second Oscar for\u00a0<em><a>Green Book</a>.\u00a0</em></p6>\n<p15>Pine also had a small role in\u00a0<em>Into the Spiderverse,\u00a0</em>voicing the original Peter Parker in Miles' dimension. The character appears only at the beginning of the film, and Pine only speaks a few lines.</p15>\n<p18>Before Andrew Garfield's casting, a viral Twitter campaign suggested Donald Glover as the new incarnation of the friendly neighborhood. Glover didn't audition, but Miles Morales' creator, Brian Michael Bendis,\u00a0<a>did credit Glover with influencing the character's look</a>\u00a0after his\u00a0<em>Community</em> character, Troy Barnes, appeared wearing a Spider-Man pajama.</p18>\n<p20>Mark Hamill is a true legend when it comes to comic book characters. Known worldwide for his portrayal of Luke Skywalker in the\u00a0<em>Star Wars</em> franchise, Hamill is also notorious for voicing the Joker in multiple projects across numerous forms of media.</p20>\n<p21>The actor also played James Jesse, AKA The Trickster, in the 90s TV series\u00a0<em>The Flash</em>. He reprised the role in The CW show,\u00a0<em>The Flash</em>, fourteen years after first playing him.</p21>\n</div>\n</article>\n</html1>"
