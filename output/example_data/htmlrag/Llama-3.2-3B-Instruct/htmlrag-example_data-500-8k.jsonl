This index of 30 <a>blue chip companies</a> has been shorthand for the broad market since it was first published in 1896.</p><p>Although there are better barometers for the performance of the overall stock market, even today the Dow tends to get first billing over other indexes such as the <b>Nasdaq\u00a0</b>(<a>NASDAQINDEX:^IXIC</a>) and the <b>S&amp;P 500</b> (<a>SNPINDEX:^GSPC</a>) on newscasts and financial news websites.</p>\n</section0>\n<section1>\n<h2>What companies are in the Dow?</h2><h2>What companies are in the Dow?</h2><p>The <a>Dow Jones Industrial Average</a> has been made up of 30 companies since 1928, which is why it's also known as the Dow 30. Even though it's called the Dow Jones Industrial Average, distinguishing it from other Dow Jones indexes such as the Dow Jones Transportation Average, the word \"industrial\" is an anachronism.</p><p>The index was once made up of industrial companies such as manufacturers and agricultural companies, but today it's a diverse snapshot of the stock market, containing representatives from nearly every major <a>stock market sector</a>, including technology, consumer goods, healthcare, and energy, as well as industrials. The only exceptions are transportation and utilities, which have their own Dow Jones indexes.</p><p>According to <b>S&amp;P Global</b> (<span><a>SPGI</a> <span> -0.74%</span></span>), which operates both the Dow Jones and the S&amp;P 500, there are few specific requirements for Dow components. They must be members of the <a>S&amp;P 500</a>, which comes with its own set of requirements, including being based in the U.S. and being profitable at the time of admission. S&amp;P Global has said that a stock is admitted to the Dow 30 \"only if the company has an excellent reputation, demonstrates sustained growth and is of interest to a large number of investors.\"</p><p>The Dow index is price-weighted, meaning that each stock's impact on the index is determined by its share price. As a result, companies may be excluded based on a share price that is too high -- for example, in the $1,000 range -- or too low. The index managers also strive for a balance across sectors.</p><p>There is no set protocol for changing Dow components, but S&amp;P Global has refreshed the index every few years by pulling two or three stocks and adding new ones. The company says that can happen because of \"corporate actions\" or \"market developments.\"</p><p>Dow companies tend to be well-known, mature companies with leading market positions. The chart below shows the 30 companies currently in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.</p>\n</section1>\n<section3>\n<p>Finally, the Dow has been slower than other indexes to evolve with the fast growth of the <a>technology sector</a>. Although the Dow added Apple back in 2015, Alphabet, Amazon, <b>Meta Platforms</b> (<span><a>META</a> <span> -1.6%</span></span>),\u00a0and <b>Nvidia</b> (<span><a>NVDA</a> <span> 0.86%</span></span>), which have a combined market cap of around $4 trillion, are all absent from the index. The tech companies it does contain -- such as Intel and Cisco -- seem like dated legacy players, and both have performed poorly in recent years.</p><p>Despite the criticism, the Dow is still a useful yardstick for measuring stock market performance, especially as many of its components are leading companies. Although it shouldn't be the only index you use to examine the stock market, understanding its strengths and weaknesses and what drives its movements will help you better assess the performance of the overall stock market.</p>\n</section3>\n</div0>\n</div0>\n</html0>\n<html1>\n<title>Dow Jones Stocks To Watch Today: Salesforce, Microsoft Rally On Nvidia Earnings</title>\n<div0>\n<article>\n<header>\n<a>Research</a> <h1>\nToday's Dow Jones Stocks To Watch: Apple Stock Dives On Slowing iPhone Sales </h1>\n<div>\n<a>Licensing</a>\n<ul>\n<a>SCOTT LEHTONEN</a>\n<li>02:20 PM ET 03/05/2024</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</header>\n<div>\n<p0>The <a>Dow Jones Industrial Average</a> ended February at new highs, as the ongoing stock market rally continues.

Those which only sell direct-to-consumer and are not based in the US are excluded. The list is limited to brands where the celebrity or influencer is listed as the founder, co-founder or was involved in development, marketing and production. Brands started by influencers who were professional hairstylists and makeup artists before gaining fame were excluded.</p>\n<p>We defined a beauty brand as one that sells cosmetics, skincare, hair care, nail polish and false eyelashes. Brands that primarily sell fragrance were excluded. Separate brands from the same celebrity are counted as a new brand. Our data is extensive, but not exhaustive. Celebrities are organized on the timeline according to a beauty product line\u2019s launch date. Celebrities who had existing brands that expanded into a beauty category are categorized by when the beauty products were first launched.</p>\n<p>In conducting sentiment analysis, we collected and analyzed all comments on all posts that matched a keyword search of the celebrity and their brand name in r/BeautyGuruChatter. Each comment was assigned a sentiment score: an aggregate of how positive, negative or neutral all words in the comment are, based on three different sentiment dictionaries that score words based on whether they are more positive, neutral or negative. Comments with fewer than 30 characters were excluded. Each brand\u2019s average sentiment score was calculated by taking the mean of all the scored comments relating to that brand.</p> </div>\n</div1>\n</div0>\n <div><span1>7 most successful celebrity beauty brands in the world, from Selena Gomez\u2019 Rare Beauty and Rihanna\u2019s multimillion-dollar Fenty Beauty, to Kylie Jenner\u2019s Kylie Cosmetics and Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s Goop</span1><figcaption>Celebrities that have their own successful beauty brands, from Selena Gomez and Rihanna to Gwyneth Paltrow.

I'm Terry Gross. When we originally scheduled the interview we're about to hear, we didn't realize how weirdly timely it would be. Let's face it - the pandemic has made death a presence on a scale most of us aren't used to. Your beliefs about what happens after death or if anything happens might shape how you're dealing with your fears and anxieties. In the new book, \"Heaven And Hell: A History Of The Afterlife,\" my guest Bart Ehrman writes about where the ideas of heaven and hell came from. He examines the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, as well as writings from the Greek and Roman era.</p1><p14>GROSS: One of the theses of your book about the history of heaven and how is that views of heaven and hell don't go back to the earliest stages of Christianity, and they're not in the Old Testament or in Jesus' teachings. They're not?</p14><p16>GROSS: Are there things in the Hebrew Bible that still support the idea of heaven and hell as people came to understand it, things that you can extract from the Old Testament that might not literally mention heaven and hell but still support the vision that emerged of it?</p16><p21>EHRMAN: Yeah, no, it's a good question. And people generally point to these passages in the Book of Psalms that talk about Sheol, or Sheol. It's a word that gets mistranslated into English. Sometimes Sheol is translated by the word hell, and it absolutely is not what people think of as hell. Sometimes Sheol is talked about by people today as a place that's kind of like the Greek Hades, a place where everybody goes after they die, and they aren't really physical beings down there; they're just kind of like souls, and they exist forever there, and there's nothing to do, and they do - they're all the same. And so Sheol is sometimes portrayed like that. The Bible does talk about this place Sheol, especially in poetry, especially in Psalms. And it's probably not a place that people go to, per se.</p21><p25>GROSS: Why don't we take a short break here? And then we'll talk about the history of ideas of heaven and hell. If you're just joining us, my guest is Bart Ehrman. He's the author of the new book \"Heaven And Hell: A History Of The Afterlife.\" We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR.</p25><p27>GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Bart Ehrman, author of the new book \"Heaven And Hell: A History Of The Afterlife.\" He's a distinguished professor of religious studies at The University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.</p27><p38>GROSS: So you were saying there really isn't an explicit description of heaven and hell in the Hebrew Bible or even in the New Testament, but that Paul is important in understanding the history of heaven and hell. Tell us about what Paul wrote.</p38><p45>GROSS: We have to take a short break here. So let's do that, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Bart Ehrman, who is the author of the new book \"Heaven And Hell: A History Of The Afterlife.\" He's a distinguished professor of religious studies at The University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.

I'm Terry Gross, back with Bart Ehrman, author of the new book \"Heaven And Hell: A History Of The Afterlife.\" He's a distinguished professor of Religious Studies at The University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill and is one of America's most widely read scholars of early Christianity and the New Testament. His earlier books include \"Misquoting Jesus\" and \"How Jesus Became God.\"</p47><p52>GROSS: So your new book is about the history of heaven and hell. Your forthcoming book that you're working on now is going to be called \"Expecting Armageddon.\" So how does the Book of Revelation contribute to the vision of hell?</p52><p62>GROSS: Let's take a break here, and then we'll talk some more.

So the bottom line of the book is that the way you kind of trace the history of heaven and hell is that when people thought that everybody dies and it's the same for everybody forever, they thought, well, that's not fair. Surely, if there are gods in the world or God in the world, there has to be justice. So suffering now must be rewarded later, and wicked behavior now must be punished later. And so they came up with the idea of an afterlife with rewards and punishments.</p86><p98>GROSS: Thank you. Bart Ehrman's new book is called \"Heaven And Hell: The History Of The Afterlife.\" And if you're thinking, but what about this passage in the Old Testament or what about that passage in the New Testament, let me just say we only had time to touch on a few of the points in Bart Ehrman's book, so if you want to know more about what he has to say about the history of the afterlife, I refer you to his book. Bart Ehrman, thank you again.</p98><p100>GROSS: Bart Ehrman is the author of the new book \"Heaven And Hell: A History Of The Afterlife.\"</p100></p0>\n</article>\n</main>\n<html1>\n<title>Heaven vs Hell - Difference and Comparison | Diffen</title>\n<body>\n<h1>Heaven vs. Hell</h1>\n<div1>\n<div0>\n<div>\n<a>Diffen</a> \u203a                       <a>Philosophy</a> \u203a                      <a>Religion</a> </div>\n<p>Several religions of the world have a concept of afterlife in <b>heaven</b> or <b>hell</b>.

This is the main meaning of the word in the <a>Bible</a>. It was considered the dwelling place of <a>God</a> and his <a>angels</a>. However, with time, the term came to be used also in the sense of the abode of the righteous at some point after death. This is supported by a few verses in the Bible, but the Bible tends to use other terms, such as <a>Paradise</a>, for this. (See below for other terms.)\n</p0>\n<p1>Hell, according to many religious beliefs, is an afterlife of suffering where the wicked or unrighteous dead are punished. Hell is almost always depicted as underground. Within Islam hell is traditionally depicted as fiery. Some other traditions, however, portray Hell as cold and gloomy. Punishment in Hell typically corresponds to sins committed in life.\n</p1>\n<p4>In Christianity, the popularly used word Hell, however, is a translation of three Greek words: hades, Gehenna, and Tartarus. Hades, literally meaning unseen, usually refers to the state of death, which is defined by some as a conscious waiting place for resurrection, and by others as a state of unconsciousness synonymous with death itself. Gehenna, on the other hand, more ambiguous than hades, seems to refer to judgment and fits more closely with the modern conceptions of Hell. Tartarus is used in reference to the judgment of sinning angels and seems to be an allusion to Greek mythology (see <a>Tartarus</a>).\nWhile the majority of Christianity views Hell as a place of eternal torment, some Christians, such as Universalist Christians (see <a>Universalism</a>) contend that after resurrection, unrepentant sinners are judged and purified in the lake of fire and then later accepted into Heaven, while others believe that after resurrection, the unrepentant sinners are permanently destroyed in the lake of fire (see <a>annihilationism</a>).\nVarious interpretations of the torments of Hell exist, ranging from fiery pits of wailing sinners to lonely isolation from God's presence. However, the descriptions of Hell found in the Bible are quite vague. The books of Matthew, Mark, and Jude tell of a place of fire, while the books of Luke and Revelation report it as an abyss. Our modern, more graphic, images of Hell have developed from writings that are not found in the Bible. Dante's <a>The Divine Comedy</a> is a classic inspiration for modern images of Hell. Other early Christian writings also illustrate the anguish of Hell. Most Christians believe that damnation occurs immediately upon death (<a>particular judgment</a>), and others that it occurs after <a>Judgment Day</a>, which is written about in the book of <a>Revelation</a>. \n</p4>\n<p9>While the concept of heaven (malkuth hashamaim \u05de\u05dc\u05db\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05e9\u05de\u05d9\u05dd\u2014<a>The Kingdom of Heaven</a>) is well-defined within the Christian and Islamic religions, the Jewish concept of the afterlife, sometimes known as \"<a>olam haba</a>\", the world to come, seems to have been disputed between various early sects such as the <a>Sadducees</a>, and thus never set forth in a systematic or official fashion as was done in Christianity and Islam. Jewish writings refer to a \"new earth\" as the abode of mankind following the resurrection of the dead. Judaism does, however, have a belief in Heaven, not as a future abode for \"good souls\", but as the \"place\" where God \"resides\".\n<a>Jewish mysticism</a> recognizes <a>seven heavens</a>. In order from lowest to highest, the seven Heavens are listed alongside the angels who govern them and any further information:\n</p9>\n<ol0><li> <a>Shamayim</a>: The first Heaven, governed by <a>Archangel Gabriel</a>, is the closest of heavenly realms to the Earth; it is also considered the abode of <a>Adam</a> and <a>Eve</a>. \n</li><li> Raquia: The second Heaven is dually controlled by Zachariel and <a>Raphael</a>. It was in this Heaven that <a>Moses</a>, during his visit to Paradise, encountered the angel <a>Nuriel</a> who stood \"300 <a>parasangs</a> high, with a retinue of 50 myriads of angels all fashioned out of water and fire.\" Also, Raquia is considered the realm where the fallen angels are imprisoned and the planets fastened. \n</li><li> <a>Shehaqim</a>: The third Heaven, under the leadership of Anahel, serves as the home of the <a>Garden of Eden</a> and the <a>Tree of Life</a>; it is also the realm where <a>manna</a>, the holy food of angels, is produced. The <a>Second Book of Enoch</a>, meanwhile, states that both Paradise and Hell are accommodated in Shehaqim with Hell being located simply \" on the northern side.\" \n</li><li> Machonon: The fourth Heaven is ruled by the <a>Archangel Michael</a>, and according to <a>Talmud</a> Hagiga, it contains the heavenly <a>Jerusalem</a>, the Temple, and the Altar. \n</li><li> <a>Machon</a>: The fifth Heaven is under the administration of <a>Samael</a>, an angel referred to as evil by some, but who is to others merely a dark servant of God. \n</li><li> <a>Zebul</a>: The sixth Heaven falls under the jurisdiction of Zachiel. \n</li><li> <a>Araboth</a>: The seventh Heaven, under the leadership of <a>Cassiel</a>, is the holiest of the seven Heavens provided the fact that it houses the Throne of Glory attended by the Seven Archangels and serves as the realm in which God dwells; underneath the throne itself lies the <a>abode</a> of all unborn human souls. It is also considered the home of the <a>Seraphim</a>, the <a>Cherubim</a>, and the <a>Hayyoth</a>. \n</li></ol0>\n<p12>Muslims believe in <a>jahannam</a> (in Arabic: \u062c\u0647\u0646\u0645) (which comes from the Hebrew word gehennim and resembles the versions of Hell in Christianity). In the Qur'an, the holy book of Islam, there are literal descriptions of the condemned in a fiery Hell, as contrasted to the garden-like Paradise (<a>jannah</a>) enjoyed by righteous believers.\nIn addition, Heaven and Hell are split into many different levels depending on the actions perpetrated in life, where punishment is given depending on the level of evil done in life, and good is separated into other levels depending on how well one followed God while alive.\nThere is an equal number of mentions of both Hell and paradise in the Qur'an, which is considered by believers to be among the numeric miracles in the Qur'an.[citation needed]\nThe Islamic concept of Hell is similar to the medieval Christian view of Dante. [citation needed] However, Satan is not viewed as Hell's ruler, merely one of its sufferers. The gate of Hell is guarded by <a>Maalik</a> also known as Zabaaniyah. The Quran states that the fuel of Hellfire is rocks/stones (idols) and human beings.\nNames of Hell according to Islamic Tradition based on the Quranic ayah and Hadith:\n</p12>\n<ul> <a>wikipedia:Hell</a>\n<a>wikipedia:Heaven</a>\n<a>The concept of Hell - <i>The Economist</i></a>\n</ul>\n</div3>\n<div5>\n<p>Share this comparison via: \n</p>\n<p>If you read this far, you should follow us:\n</p>\n<p>\"Heaven vs Hell.\" <i>Diffen.com.</i> Diffen LLC, n.d.

Scripture teaches that when we die we go to be with Christ, immediately joining him in heaven. For example, Jesus tells the thief crucified along with him, \u201ctoday you will be with me in paradise\u201d (Luke 23:43).

Here's a look at McIlroy's performance at majors and the U.S. Open as he looks to win one for the first time in nine years.</p4><h20>How many majors has Rory McIlroy won?</h20><p5>McIlroy has won four major tournaments. They are as follows:</p5><h21>When was the last time Rory McIlroy won a major?</h21><p6>McIlroy hasn't won a major championship in just about eight years. He emerged victoriously at the PGA Championship in 2014, at Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, Ky.</p6><p7>McIlroy trailed by one stroke after the first round but moved into sole possession of first place after 36 holes. He staved off fierce competition from Phil Mickelson, Rickie Fowler and Henrick Stenson in the final round to earn a one-stroke victory, making par on the 18th hole. He shot 16-under for the event, and it marked his second consecutive major win.\u00a0</p7><span0>McIlroy has won the U.S. Open. In fact, it was the first major he won during his career.</span0><span1>McIlroy, then 22, won the U.S. Open in 2011 at Congressional Golf Club in Bethesda, Md. He ran away with the event, carding a 16-under for the tournament and winning by eight strokes. He led the tournament from wire to wire thanks to the 6-under 65 he posted in Round 1 of the tournament. </span1><h23>What major has Rory McIlroy not won?</h23><p10>McIlroy has yet to win the Masters, though he has come close on several occasions. He finished second in 2022, with Scottie Scheffler denying the Northern Irishman the career Grand Slam.</p10><p12>McIlroy's results at Augusta by year:</p12><h24>Rory McIlroy majors timeline</h24><p13>McIlroy first participated in a major tournament in 2007. He competed in the British Open and finished tied for 42nd as a low amateur.</p13><p14>McIlroy debuted at every other major in 2009. Since then, he has participated in all four majors every year with two exceptions. He didn't play at the British Open in 2015 because of an ankle injury, and the 2020 event was canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p14><p15>McIlroy won his first major in 2011 at the U.S. Open. He ran away with the tournament, winning by eight strokes. He and Robert Garrigus became the fifth and sixth players to shoot under par in all four rounds in a single U.S. Open championship.</p15><p16>McIlroy followed his success with his win at the PGA Championship in 2012. He won his third and fourth majors back-to-back in 2014 at the British Open and PGA Championship.</p16><p17>All told, McIlroy has participated in 57 majors during his career. He has logged 28 top-10 finishes in those events: eight at the PGA Championship, seven at the U.S. Open,\u00a0seven at the Masters\u00a0and six at the British Open.</p17><p18>McIlroy's best tournaments overall are the PGA Championship and the Masters. He has missed the cut a combined four times at those events and has won the PGA Championship twice. His best major season was in 2014, when he won the PGA and the British Open, finished tied for eighth at the Masters and tied for 23rd at the U.S. Open.</p18>\n</div1>\n</div0>\n    <div>   <article0> <div> <div> <span>2024</span> <h3>Rory wins his fourth Hero Dubai Desert Classic.</h3> <a>Explore</a> </div> <div>Close</div> </div> <div> <p>Rory wins the tournament for the 4th time.</p> <div> <p>I\u2019ve never lost the hunger to go out and play better, but I\u2019ve also never lost the joy of the game.</p> <div>Rory McIlroy</div> </div> </div> </article0> <article1> <div> <div> <span>2023</span> <h3>Rory wins the DP World Tour title for a fifth time.</h3> <a>Explore</a> </div> <div>Close</div> </div> <div> <p>Rory wins the DP World Tour title for a fifth time.</p> <div> <p>I think winning shows my consistency year-to-year.

But while the typical stock in the S&amp;P 500 yields only about 1.6% at present, the highest-yielding S&amp;P 500 dividend stocks all deliver yields north of 6% \u2013 roughly four times the typical large U.S. company. That kind of high-octane income potential is a different story altogether.</p1><p2>There's admittedly some risk in companies like that, as now-generous dividends can be overshadowed by declines in share price or the risk of future cutbacks. But if you're looking to get a bit more out of your dividend stocks, consider these high-yield companies:</p2>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Stock</td>\n<td>Dividend yield*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pfizer Inc. (ticker: <a>PFE</a>)</td>\n<td>6.3%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Devon Energy Corp. (<a>DVN</a>)</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Whirlpool Corp. (<a>WHR</a>)</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3M Co. (<a>MMM</a>)</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Kinder Morgan Inc. (<a>KMI</a>)</td>\n<td>6.6%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>AT&amp;T Inc. (<a>T</a>)</td>\n<td>6.7%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Verizon Communications Inc. (<a>VZ</a>)</td>\n<td>6.7%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Healthpeak Properties Inc. (<a>PEAK</a>)</td>\n<td>7.4%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Altria Group Inc. (<a>MO</a>)</td>\n<td>9.6%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n<ul0>\n<li><b>Market value:</b> $152 billion</li>\n<li><b>Dividend yield: </b>6.3%</li>\n</ul0><p3>A relative newcomer to the lineup of top S&amp;P 500 <a>dividend stocks</a>, Pfizer is a classic case of a company that has become a yield monster lately for all the wrong reasons. Yes, it has a long tradition of sharing the wealth with shareholders, with its first-quarter payday marking the 341st consecutive quarterly dividend paid by Pfizer \u2013 a track record that spans more than 85 years. </p3><p5>Oil and gas exploration company Devon is perhaps one of the most risky dividend stocks on this list, thanks to its uncertain payout structure. Generous but variable dividends are provided by DVN based on its <a>free cash flow</a>, which means investors are banking on strong energy pricing in order to power these currently generous but potentially uncertain distributions. Unfortunately, as energy prices have softened a bit in the last few years, shares of Devon have crashed more than 40% from their October 2022 highs. </p5><ul2>\n<li><b>Market value:</b> $6 billion</li>\n<li><b>Dividend yield:</b> 6.5%</li>\n</ul2><ul3>\n<li><b>Market value:</b> $50 billion</li>\n<li><b>Dividend yield:</b> 6.5%</li>\n</ul3><p9>Obviously the loss of a substantive cash-generating part of its operations means the nominal payout per share will decrease. But investors are uncertain about whether the yield will shrink even faster than the rest of the firm, and have punished 3M as a result of that and other uncertainties. Still, for the time being, the current operations of 3M make it qualify as one of the highest dividend-paying stocks in the S&amp;P 500. Tread lightly and watch the news closely if you're interested in 3M right now.\u00a0</p9><ul4>\n<li><b>Market value: </b>$38 billion</li>\n<li><b>Dividend yield: </b>6.6%</li>\n</ul4><ul5>\n<li><b>Market value: </b>$120 billion</li>\n<li><b>Dividend yield:</b> 6.7%</li>\n</ul5><ul6>\n<li><b>Market value: </b>$168 billion</li>\n<li><b>Dividend yield: </b>6.7%</li>\n</ul6><p14>Another entrenched telecom behemoth that makes the list of top S&amp;P 500 dividend stocks is Verizon. In fact, if you were impressed by AT&amp;T's cash flow, then the even larger $18.7 billion put up by VZ in 2023 will be music to your ears. This is an incredibly strong position for the company, allowing it to comfortably service its debt and continue paying generous dividends to shareholders.</p14><ul7>\n<li><b>Market value:</b> $9 billion</li>\n<li><b>Dividend yield: </b>7.4%</li>\n</ul7><ul8>\n<li><b>Market value:</b> $72 billion</li>\n<li><b>Dividend yield:</b> 9.6%</li>\n</ul8><p17>Altria is a popular dividend stock that has been atop the list of the highest-paying S&amp;P 500 dividend stocks for a while. That's because of its consistent and reliable yield and a great track record of increases in its payouts. Specifically, the stock has logged 55 consecutive years of dividend increases \u2013 longer than many other dividend stocks have even been in operation. Of course, growth is challenged for this tobacco giant that produces Marlboro cigarettes, Black &amp; Mild pipe and cigar products, and smokeless tobacco like Copenhagen and Skoal. But it has stable operations and dominates the U.S. market for those who are looking for a nicotine fix. If you want to trade growth potential for income potential, MO may be a stock that fits the bill.</p17></div0></div0>\n</html0>\n<title>2024 High Dividend Stocks List | Highest Yields Up To 24.9%</title>\n<div0>\n<h2>2024 High Dividend Stocks List | Highest Yields Up To 24.9%</h2>\n<div0>\n<p0><strong>High dividend stocks\u00a0</strong>are stocks with a dividend yield <em>well in excess</em> of the market average dividend yield of ~1.4%.</p0>\n<p2>\n<p2>The free high dividend stocks list spreadsheet has our full list of ~<strong>230</strong>\u00a0<strong>individual securities</strong> (stocks, REITs, MLPs, etc.) <strong>with 5%+ dividend yields</strong>.</p2>\n<p5><a>Resource #2: The 7 Best High Yield Stocks Now</a>\nThis resource analyzes the 7 best high-yield stocks in detail.

The best dividend stocks are shares of well-established companies that increase their payouts over time. The average dividend yield of some of the top dividend stocks is 12.69%.</span2><span3>20 high-dividend stocks</span3><span4>Below is a list of 20 of the highest-dividend stocks headquartered in the U.S., ordered by annual dividend yield. This list also takes into account the 5-year average dividend growth rate and dividend payout consistency and includes companies from either the S&amp;P 500 or Russell 2000. </span4><span15>You can screen for stocks that pay dividends on many financial sites, as well as on your online broker's website. We've also included a list of high-dividend stocks below.</span15><span18>To look under the hood of a high-dividend stock, start by comparing the dividend yields among its peers. If a company\u2019s dividend yield is much higher than that of similar companies, it could be a red flag. At the very least, it\u2019s worth additional research into the company and the safety of the dividend.</span18><span20>The No. 1 consideration in buying a dividend stock is the safety of its dividend. Dividend yields over 4% should be carefully scrutinized; those over 10% tread firmly into risky territory. Among other things, a too-high dividend yield can indicate the payout is unsustainable, or that investors are selling the stock, driving down its share price and increasing the dividend yield as a result.</span20><span22>Are these the best dividend stocks?</span22><span23>The stocks in the chart may have high yields, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they're the best dividend stocks for any investor. The ideal portfolio varies person to person, based on individual goals and timelines for those goals. Besides, many investors are better off buying index funds rather than individual stocks.</span23><span24>A high dividend yield can also indicate many things, and not all of them are good. As stated previously, falling stock prices can increase dividend yields, and some companies go into debt by overspending on their dividend. The over-spenders may eventually be forced to cut their dividends if they become unsustainably expensive.</span24></div1>\n<div>\n<p0><span>It's easy to <a>chase high dividend stocks</a> \u2014 and even easier to <a>lose money on them if they fall</a>. There's a better way to find high dividend yields you can count on to make you money \u2014 which includes stocks like materials company <strong>Rio Tinto</strong></span><span> (<a>RIO</a>) and financials like </span><span><b>T. Rowe Price</b> (<a>TROW</a>) plus <strong>Federal Agricultural Mortgage</strong></span><span> (<a>AGM</a>).</span></p0>\n<span2>What's an investor looking for high dividend stocks to do then? Find stocks with market-beating yields and shares that at least keep pace with the market long term. That way you get a rich dividend that isn't eroded by a faltering stock price.</span2>\n<span3>To help you find such opportunities, Investor's Business Daily pinpoints high dividend stocks that yield at least 3%, which is more than double the <a>Standard &amp; Poor's 500</a> (yielding roughly 1.3%). But, just as importantly, they have a stock price that at least keeps up with the market.</span3>\n<p5>This is why\u00a0<span>chasing yield is often a bad idea when looking for high-dividend stocks. High yields are often a mathematical distortion of a declining stock.</span></p5>\n<p7>Take <strong>Occidental Petroleum</strong> (<a>OXY</a>), one of <a>Warren Buffett's high dividend stock darlings</a>, as an example. The stock yielded 7.7% going into 2020. Shares of the energy company dropped 50% though, during the year. Additionally, the company slashed its dividend. That left investors with a net loss of more than 50%, even with the remaining paltry 0.2% dividend.</p7>\n<p8>Keep in mind, too, companies paying high dividends can cut them when the business wanes. Occidental did that in 2020. <strong>Ford</strong> (<a>F</a>) cut its storied dividend in the first quarter of 2020 to nothing, down from the 15 cents a share it paid previously. Ford's dividend yield was 6.5% in early 2020. It's just 2.6% now.</p8>\n<span6>So, if chasing yield doesn't work, what does? One IBD strategy looks for high-dividend stocks with signs of stability going for them. Specifically, these stocks have: </span6>\n<ul>\n<span>High dividend yields of 3%-plus. That's more than 100% higher than the S&amp;P's 1.3% yield. </span>\n<span>Three- and five-year earnings growth of 10%-plus.</span>\n<span>Earnings stability of 20 or better. Earnings stability is measured by looking at how much earnings per share swings from the five-year trend. A lower number indicates more stability.</span>\n<span>No cuts to the dividend <a>(which will be harder to find after 2020)</a>. </span>\n</ul>\n<h21><b>High Dividend Yield Winner</b><b>: Rio Tinto</b></h21>\n<span10>When you've narrowed down the list of high-dividend stocks this much, it's OK to look for the top dividend yields. That title goes to Rio Tinto. Based in London, Rio Tinto mines and processes materials ranging from aluminum to copper and diamonds. And it yields a lucrative 9.7%. Additionally, the company's yield is up more than 34% over the past five years.</span10>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>Symbol</th>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th>Indicated yield %</th>\n<th>3 year EPS growth rate (%)</th>\n<th>EPS growth rate % 5 year</th>\n<th>EPS 5 year stability factor</th>\n<th>Dividend growth (5 year)</th>\n<th>Composite Rating</th>\n<th>5-year price ch. % vs. S&amp;P 500</th>\n</tr>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td> (<a>MED</a>)</td>\n<td>Medifast</td>\n<td>3.6%</td>\n<td>46%</td>\n<td>53%</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>43%</td>\n<td>73</td>\n<td>235%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td> (<a>RIO</a>)</td>\n<td>Rio Tinto Plc</td>\n<td>9.7%</td>\n<td>40%</td>\n<td>28%</td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>34%</td>\n<td>96</td>\n<td>107%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td> (<a>ABBV</a>)</td>\n<td>AbbVie</td>\n<td>3.5%</td>\n<td>18%</td>\n<td>22%</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>18%</td>\n<td>95</td>\n<td>65%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td> (<a>WSO</a>)</td>\n<td>Watsco</td>\n<td>3.1%</td>\n<td>17%</td>\n<td>12%</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>13%</td>\n<td>84</td>\n<td>24%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td> (<a>MS</a>)</td>\n<td>Morgan Stanley</td>\n<td>3.3%</td>\n<td>27%</td>\n<td>21%</td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>22%</td>\n<td>69</td>\n<td>20%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td> (<a>AGMA</a>)</td>\n<td>Federal Agric Mtg Cl A</td>\n<td>3.5%</td>\n<td>11%</td>\n<td>16%</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>26%</td>\n<td>68</td>\n<td>13%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td> (<a>CCI</a>)</td>\n<td>Crown Castle Intl</td>\n<td>3.1%</td>\n<td>30%</td>\n<td>24%</td>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>8%</td>\n<td>91</td>\n<td>12%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td> (<a>TROW</a>)</td>\n<td>T Rowe Price Group</td>\n<td>3.5%</td>\n<td>23%</td>\n<td>22%</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>27%</td>\n<td>59</td>\n<td>9%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<a0>Best Dividend Stocks In 2019: 5 High-Yield Stocks Beating The S&amp;P 500</a0>\n</div>"

Should it ever happen, these are the actors we want in the Invincible Live Action movie.</p0>\n<h20>Mark Grayson \u2013 Ryan Potter</h20>\n<p1>The titular character of the series is of mixed race. Mark Grayson\u2019s mother is Asian American. So don\u2019t start blowing horns. Ryan Potter is best known for voicing Hiro Hamada in Big Hero 6. He may not be a widely well-known actor but he has the skills and the look to pull this off. Mark Grayson starts out as a teenager, which just so happens to be the age bracket of Potter.</p1>\n<strong0>You May Also Like: <a>10 Reasons Why Invincible (&amp; Not Falcon And Winter Soldier) Is 2021\u2019s Greatest Superhero Show</a></strong0>\n<h21>Omni-Man \u2013 Joe Manganiello</h21>\n<p2>People might be furious as to why we did not pick Javier Bardem or John Hamm for the role. while both are terrific actors, playing Omni-Man requires an actor who is a seasoned veteran in playing the mysterious, violent vigilante. Joe Manganiello has the experience and the acting chops to play Omni-Man. He has already played a comic book character \u2013 Deathstroke. And who else do you think could pull off the role of a Family Man with the body of a Greek God?</p2>\n<h22>Deborah Grayson \u2013 Lucy Liu</h22>\n<p3>Lucy Liu is a seasoned actor in the film industry. Deborah Grayson is not actually portrayed as a character of Asian descent in the first seven issues. But the fans have seen her as such. Considering an Asian-American actor voices her in the series and Mark is also considered to have Asian ancestry, Lucy Liu is the perfect choice. She is known to play powerful female characters on screen like Watson in Elementary and her role in Charlie\u2019s Angels.</p3>\n<p4>It was a close call between Bella Thorne, Emma Stone, and Katherine Langford. Emma was too old to play Atom Eve. Between Bella Thorne and Katherine Langford, we believe the latter is a better choice. Her roles in 13 Reasons Why and Cursed have shown she plays charactersgoing through internal conflict really well.</p4>\n<h24>Allen the Alien \u2013 Alan Tudyk</h24>\n<p5>There were some fan circles that said the best choice for an actor to portray Allen the Alien is seth Rogen. But we believe it is Alan Tudyk. Allen the Alien, in the Invincible Universe, is the last of his race, genetically designed to fight the mighty Viltrumites. he is smart, funny, clueless, and innocent as a bee at times. Alan Tudyk would require some CGI to buff up his musculature though. But the eccentricities of the character could not be played better by anyone other than Tudyk.</p5>\n<h25>Mauler Twins \u2013 Terry Crews</h25>\n<p6>The Mauler Twins are one of the first villains Invincible fought and defeated. ironically they are not actually twins. They are clones. But it is hard to find out which one is the clone so they always bicker amongst themselves as to who came first. The Twins wield some heavy scientific knowledge. Terry Crews could play both the Mauler Twins in a live action series. he has the phsycique and the comic timing to create the perfect Mauler Twins impression.</p6>\n<p7>They may be side characters but they still play a major role in the character development of Invincible as a superhero. Amber is Mark\u2019s first girlfriend who ends up breaking up with him when she finds out Mark is keeping secrets from her. William is Mark\u2019s best friend. He is also gay. Cameron Monaghan of Gotham comes to mind.</p7>\n<p8>Cecil Stadman is like the Nick Fury of the Invincible Universe. His job is to keep things together. Like Nick Fury is the Director of SHIELD, Cecil Stedman heads the Global defense Agency. He is also the guy the Guardians of the Globe and Omni-Man answer to. Walton Goggins actually voices the character in the series. He even looks the part. It is only natural he takes up the live action role of the character as well.</p8>\n<p9>Thragg is the Supreme Ruler of the Viltrumite Empire. He is the most powerful Viltrumite to ever exist. No one in the known universe, not even Omni-Man, could defeat Thragg in his absolute prime. He is also the big bad wolf of the Invincible Universe. A character of such stature should only be played by an actor of equal caliber. The Rock, who also plays a character with a similar set of powers in the DCEU \u2013 Black Adam, would be perfect to portray Thragg.</p9>\n<p10>Rex Splode is of Latinx descent. A brash and arrogant man, Rex was experimented on by his country as a child. He would later gain the ability to charge inorganic matter with explosive energy.\u00a0 Tyler Posey of Teen wolf fame, who boasts of a Latinx heritage, is our choice for Rex Splode. Awkwafina has recently made her presence felt in many Blockbuster movies like Jumanji: Welcome To The Jungle and Shang-Chi. She fits into the roel of Dupli-Kate, a girl with the ability to create multiple clones of herself.</p10>\n<h210>Robot &amp; Monster Girl \u2013 Paul Bettany &amp; Millie Bobbie Brown</h210>\n<p11>Robot is basically going to be a voice actor since the android has to be brought to life using CGI. An actor who has already lent his voice for an A.I in another comic book inspired movie universe would be a perfect choice. Paul Bettany voiced JARVIS and then Vision in the MCU. He can nail the role of robot. The girl full of sass and wit, Monster Girl has the power to turn into a literal monster. But every time she turns, her human form grows a bit younger. That\u2019s her curse. Millie Bobbie Brown is young enough to portray Monster Girl in this movie.</p11>\n<strong1>Also Read: <a>Invincible: Strongest Villains Yet To Appear In The Show</a></strong1>\n<h211>The Immortal \u2013 Jeffrey Dean Morgan</h211>\n<p12>The Immortal is based on a DC Comics character named Vandal Savage. Like Savage, the Immortal was once a man who loved in pre-historic times. A mysterious event made him immortal and gave him super powers. The Immortal has been a part of almost all major events of human history. He also\u00a0 leads the Guardians of the Globe. After Omni-Man murders the team, the Immortal returns to life and goes full berserk. Our pick is Jeffrey Dean Morgan. If his role in The Walking Dead as Negan is any indication, he could play deranged characters pretty well.</p12>\n</div2>\n</div0>\n<span><a>Amazon</a><a>amazon originals</a><a>Amazon Prime</a><a>Amazon Prime Video</a><a>Amazon Studios</a><a>comic</a><a>image comics</a><a>invincible</a></span>\n</article>\n<div>\n<span>Marvel</span>\n<span>DC</span>\n<span>Gaming</span>\n<span>Anime</span>\n</div>\n</div2>\n</div0>\n<div1>\n<a>Close</a>\n<ul><li><a>Franchises</a>\n<ul>\n<a>Marvel</a>\n<a>DC</a>\n<a>Star Wars</a>\n<a>Netflix</a>\n<a>Disney</a>\n<a>Pixar</a>\n<a>Horror</a>\n<a>Wizarding World</a>\n<a>James Bond</a>\n<a>Jurassic World</a>\n<a>MonsterVerse</a>\n<a>Star Trek</a>\n<a>Fast &amp; Furious</a>\n<a>WWE</a>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<a>Movies</a>\n<a>TV</a>\n<li><a>Gaming</a>\n<ul>\n<a>Xbox</a>\n<a>PlayStation</a>\n<a>Nintendo</a>\n<a>PC</a>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<a>Celebrities</a>\n<a>Anime</a>\n<a>Tech</a>\n<a>Exclusives</a>\n<a>Trailers</a>\n<li><a>More</a>\n<ul>\n<a>Reviews</a>\n<a>Lists</a>\n<li><a>Podcasts</a>\n<a>Cinema Stubs</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<span>Facebook</span>\n<span>Twitter</span>\n<span>Insta</span>\n<span>LinkedIn</span>\n<span>YT</span>\n</ul>\n<form>\n<span>Search for:</span>\n<button>Search</button>\n</form>\n<ul><a>T &amp; C</a>\n<a>Privacy Policy</a>\n<a>Ethics Policy</a>\n<a>Editorial Policy</a>\n<a>Fact-Checking Policy</a>\n<a>Correction Policy</a>\n<a>Editorial Team</a>\n<a>About</a>\n<a>Contact</a>\n<a>Careers</a>\n</ul>\n</div1>\n</body>\n</html0>\n<html1>\n<title>10 Actors Who Have Played A Comic Book Character In Both Live-Action &amp; Animation</title>\n<body>\n<header>\n<h1>Screen Rant</h1>\n<div>\n<a>Newsletter</a>\n<span>Log in</span>\n</div>\n<div>\n<span>Trending</span>\n<a>SR Exclusives\n                            </a>\n<a>Star Wars\n                            </a>\n<a>Marvel\n                            </a>\n<a>DC\n                            </a>\n<a>Star Trek\n                            </a>\n<a>Best on Streaming\n                            </a>\n</div>\n<div>\n<nav>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<span>Movies</span>\n<ul>\n<span>Movie Features</span>\n<span>Movie News</span>\n<span>Movie Reviews</span>\n<span>Movie Lists</span>\n<span>Movie Trailers</span>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span>TV</span>\n<ul>\n<span>TV Features</span>\n<span>TV News</span>\n<span>TV Reviews</span>\n<span>TV Lists</span>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span>Reality TV</span>\n<ul>\n<span>Reality TV Features</span>\n<span>Reality TV News</span>\n<span>Reality TV Lists</span>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span>Gaming</span>\n<ul>\n<span>Game Features</span>\n<span>Game News</span>\n<span>Game Guides</span>\n<span>Game Reviews</span>\n<span>Game Lists</span>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span>Comics</span>\n<ul>\n<span>Comic Features</span>\n<span>Comic News</span>\n<span>Comic Reviews</span>\n<span>Comic Lists</span>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span>Anime</span>\n<ul>\n<span>Anime Features</span>\n<span>Anime News</span>\n<span>Anime Lists</span>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<li>\n<span>More</span>\n<ul>\n<span>Lists</span>\n<span>Interviews</span>\n<span>Podcasts</span>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<span>Join Our Team</span>\n<span>Newsletter</span>\n<span>Advertise with us</span>\n<span>Log in</span>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n<footer>\n<ul>\n<a>Join Our Content Team</a>\n<a>Home</a>\n<a>Contact Us</a>\n<a>Terms</a>\n<a>Privacy</a>\n<a>Copyright</a>\n<a>About Us</a>\n<a>Press Kit</a>\n<a>Fact Checking Policy</a>\n<a>Corrections Policy</a>\n<a>Ethics Policy</a>\n<a>Ownership Policy</a>\n<a>Owned &amp; Operated by Valnet Inc.</a>\n</ul>\n<div>\n                Copyright \u00a9 2024 screenrant.com\n            </div>\n</footer>\n</div>\n</header>\n<article>\n<header>\n<ul>\n<a>Home</a>\n<a>Movies</a>\n<a>Movie Lists</a>\n</ul>\n<h1>10 Actors Who Have Played A Comic Book Character In Both Live-Action &amp; Animation</h1>\n<div>\n<div>\n<span>By</span>\n<a> David Caballero\n                                                        </a>\n</div>\n<time>Published Jun 10, 2021</time>\n</div>\n<p>Comic book adaptations have taken over film and television, but what famous actors have played a comic book character in live-action and animation?</p>\n</header>\n<div> <p0>The recent release of <em>Invincible</em>\u00a0showcases Oscar winner J.K. Simmons' versatility. He stars as the voice of Omni-Man, <a>a Superman-like hero with a much darker side</a>. Simmons is, of course, no stranger to comic book characters, having played J. Jonah Jameson in Sam Raimi's trilogy of\u00a0<em>Spider-Man</em> movies, as well as Commissioner Gordon in the DCEU's\u00a0<em>Justice League</em>.</p0>\n<span0>RELATED: <a>The 10 Highest-Grossing Superhero Movies Not In The MCU Or DCEU (According To Box Office Mojo)</a></span0>\n<p1>The 2000s have been the Golden Age of Superheroes, no doubt. And with so much content in movies and television, it's logical that <a>some actors pull double duty</a>. Over the years, and much like Simmons, many actors have voiced animated versions of superhero characters while also participating in live-action projects.</p1>\n<p2>Academy Award winner J.K. Simmons rose to prominence with roles in\u00a0<em>Law and Order</em> and\u00a0<em>Oz</em>. In 2002, he began playing the role of J. Jonah Jameson in <a>Sam Raimi's trilogy of\u00a0<em>Spider-Man</em> films</a>, which elevated his profile further.

It was owned by <a>NBCUniversal</a>, a division of Comcast.\n</p><p>Universal itself was the film (outside of America) and video distributor for <a>DreamWorks</a> live-action titles and <a>DWA</a> titles (Back when <a>DreamWorks Animation</a> was a division of DW before it was spun off in 2004), DreamWorks' theatrical films from 1998-2006 in American however were distributed by Universal, but through their then DreamWorks Pictures label. DreamWorks was then sold to <a>Paramount Pictures</a> in 2006, at which point Paramount took over distribution.\n</p><p>After Viacom spun off DreamWorks Studios in 2008, Universal was planned to resume distributing DreamWorks' movies, but this deal fell through as Disney took over the distribution for DreamWorks movies under the Touchstone Pictures banner starting in 2011 until 2016. In April 2016, Comcast (which owns Universal) purchased <a>DreamWorks Animation</a> for $3.8 Billion. It is therefore likely that when the current distribution deal with <a>20th Century Fox</a> finishes, <a>DreamWorks Animation</a>'s films will be distributed by Universal. <a>How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World</a> (2019) was the first DWA film distributed by Universal and as a Universal subsidiary.\n</p><p>Ever since <a>DreamWorks Pictures</a> started, the studio had rented space from Universal Studios on their backlot. This continued through the Paramount and Touchstone eras.\n</p>\n<div><h2>Contents</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a><span>1</span> <span>Units</span></a>\n<a><span>1.1</span> <span>Divisions</span></a>\n</li>\n<li><a><span>2</span> <span>Dreamworks Filmography</span></a>\n<a><span>2.1</span> <span>Upcoming</span></a>\n</li>\n<a><span>3</span> <span>Other Notable Films (Non-Dreamworks)</span></a>\n<a><span>4</span> <span>Trivia</span></a>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span>Units</span><span><span>[</span><span>]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span>Divisions</span><span><span>[</span><span>]</span></span></h3>\n<ul><span>Universal Television</span>\n<a>Universal Pictures Home Entertainment</a>\n<a>Focus Features</a>\n<li><a>Gramercy Pictures</a>\n<a>Focus World</a></li>\n<a>NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan</a>\n<a>Working Title Films</a>\n<a>DreamWorks Animation</a>\n<li><a>Illumination </a>\n<ul><a>Mac Guff</a>\n<a>Illumination Mac Guff</a></ul></li>\n<a>Universal Animation Studios</a>\n<a>Universal Cartoon Studios</a></ul>\n<h2><span>Dreamworks Filmography</span><span><span>[</span><span>]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a>How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World</a> (2019)</li>\n<li><a>Abominable</a> (2019)</li>\n<li><a>Trolls World Tour</a> (2020)</li>\n<li><a>The Croods: A New Age</a> (2020)</li>\n<li><a>The Boss Baby: Family Business</a> (2021)</li>\n<li><a>Spirit Untamed</a> (2021)</li>\n<li><a>The Bad Guys</a> (2022)</li>\n<li><a>Puss in Boots: The Last Wish</a> (2022)</li>\n<li><a>Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken</a> (2023)</li>\n<li><a>Trolls Band Together</a> (2023)</li>\n<li><a>Kung Fu Panda 4</a> (2024)</li></ul>\n<h3><span>Upcoming</span><span><span>[</span><span>]</span></span></h3>\n<li><a>The Wild Robot</a> (2024)</li>\n<h2><span>Other Notable Films (Non-Dreamworks)</span><span><span>[</span><span>]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>Universal Monsters/Dark Monsters (1931-56)</li>\n<li>The Mummy (1932-2017; TBA)</li></ul>\n<h2><span>Trivia</span><span><span>[</span><span>]</span></span></h2>\n<li><i>Monsters vs. Aliens</i> was also released through Universal International Pictures and Universal Pictures Home Entertainment despite being distributed by <a>Paramount Pictures</a>.</li>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<header>\n\t\t\tCategories\t\t\t </header>\n<ul>\n<li><a>Categories</a><span>: </span></li>\n<a>Companies</a>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div>\n\t\tCommunity content is available under <a>CC-BY-SA</a> unless otherwise noted.\t</div>\n<div>\n<header>\n\t\tMore Fandoms\n\t</header>\n<ul>\n<a>Fantasy</a>\n<a>Sci-fi</a>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</main>\n</html4>"
