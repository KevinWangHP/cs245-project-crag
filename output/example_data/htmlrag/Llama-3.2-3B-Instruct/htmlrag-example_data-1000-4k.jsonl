However, just like with any <a>make-up</a> trend, the beauty industry is constantly changing and more celebs are wanting a piece of the beauty pie!</p><p>Cosmetify specialises in showcasing the best beauty products, which makes our job all the more interesting when new celebrities enter the market. With so many new and exciting changes in the industry over the last two years, we wanted to update you on everything celebrity-beauty related!</p><p>Following on from our <a>2021 edition</a> of the most successful celebrity beauty brands, we have delved back into the world of celebrity beauty to find out who has the biggest brands in the industry right now.</p><h2>The top 20 celebrity beauty brands</h2><p>Fenty Beauty is crowned as the most successful celebrity beauty brand</p><p>Every celebrity beauty brand offers something new and exciting to the industry, but which brands have had the biggest glow-ups? Looking at factors such as revenue and social media popularity, we have compiled a list of the most successful celebrity beauty brands currently - here\u2019s what we found.</p><h3>Fenty Beauty</h3><p>After topping the rankings in our previous edition of this list, it seems that Rihanna\u2019s beauty empire is still the one to beat when it comes to successful celebrity beauty brands. Centred around providing make-up for all skin tones, <a>Fenty Beauty</a> has managed to rack up an impressive overall score of 9.76 /10 - rightfully earning its place in the top spot. In the last two years, this company has gone from strength to strength, including the fact their range is now available to buy in 8 African countries.</p><h3>Kylie Cosmetics</h3><p>Just shy of the top spot is Kylie Cosmetics with an overall beauty score of 9.64 /10. Even if you are not a massive fan of make-up, it is likely that you have heard of this brand! Founded back in 2014 by American media personality, Kylie Jenner, Kylie Cosmetics has taken the world by storm with its revolutionary <a>lip products</a>. More recently, this company has collaborated with some unexpected partners, including the limited edition Batman x Kylie range which was released last year.</p><h3>Rare Beauty</h3><p>Completing this top three list of the most successful celebrity beauty brands, with a score of 8.97 /10, is Selena Gomez\u2019s brand, Rare Beauty. With a mission statement to \u2018break down unrealistic standards of perfection\u2019, Rare Beauty sets itself apart from other brands in the industry by placing a focus on the importance of mental health alongside the sale of their high-quality make-up products. As the only entry not to have been featured in our previous edition of the top three, Rare Beauty is arguably the most impressive on this list!</p><h2>Top 10 wealthiest celebrity beauty brands 2023</h2><p>Fenty Beauty has a higher annual revenue than any other celebrity beauty brand!</p><p>There are many ways to measure the success of a brand, but revenue is arguably the most important. Because of this, we have put together a list of the wealthiest celebrity beauty brands based on their most recent annual revenue.</p><h3>Fenty Beauty</h3><p>After already being featured in the top three most successful overall beauty brands, it may come as no surprise that Fenty Beauty takes the top spot as the current wealthiest celebrity beauty brand. Earlier this year, Rihanna hit the headlines as she demonstrated the effectiveness of her Fenty Invisimatte Instant Setting &amp; Blotting Powder during her iconic performance at the SuperBowl LVII. This small three-second brand cameo is estimated to have increased the media brand value of Fenty by a whopping $5 million!</p><h2>Top 10 most successful celebrity beauty brands on Instagram 2023</h2><p>Kylie Cosmetics is the most popular celebrity beauty brand on Instagram</p><p>With so many influencers now able to make a living using social media alone, it has become common practice for businesses to have an Instagram account- and beauty brands are no exception! Below is a list of the celebrity beauty brands with the most Instagram followers.</p><h3>Kylie Cosmetics</h3><p>Making another appearance in one of these lists is Kylie Cosmetics which is the most popular celebrity beauty brand on Instagram. Before the launch of Kylie Cosmetics, Kylie Jenner made a name for herself as a figure on the television series Keeping up with the Kardashians - since then she has become one of the biggest influencers on Instagram! This Instagram success appears to have translated to Jenner\u2019s beauty empire as Kylie Cosmetics has amassed over 25,800,000 followers on the platform.</p><h2>Top 10 most Googled celebrity beauty brands 2023</h2><p>Rare Beauty is revealed as the most popular celebrity beauty brand</p><h3>Rare Beauty</h3><p>With 7,708,000 searches in the past year, Rare Beauty is rapidly becoming a household name. By promoting the importance of self-esteem and mental health, Selena Gomez\u2019s beauty brand has been hitting the headlines for all of the right reasons! Despite only launching in 2020, Rare Beauty is already making massive strides in the industry, and if their success continues then this company will be sure to challenge for the overall top spot in the coming years.</p><h2>Methodology</h2><p>We used a series of listicles to collate a list of celebrity beauty brands.</p><p>We used a range of online resources, including <a>ZoomInfo</a> and <a>Growjo</a>, to find the most recent annual revenue of each beauty brand.</p><p>We used <a>TikTok</a> to find the most recent follower count for each beauty brand.</p><p>We used <a>Instagram</a> to find the most recent follower count of each beauty brand as well as the number brand mentions they had by searching #insertbrandname.</p><p>We used Keyword Planner to find the number of worldwide searches for each brand between Feb 2022 - Jan 2023.</p><p>Finally, we used the beauty-related factors (annual revenue, TikTok and Instagram followers, Instagram brand mentions, and search data) and normalized each factor out of 10 before taking an average of those scores to get our overall \u2018beauty brand score\u2019.</p></div1></html4>"

Hades, literally meaning unseen, usually refers to the state of death, which is defined by some as a conscious waiting place for resurrection, and by others as a state of unconsciousness synonymous with death itself. Gehenna, on the other hand, more ambiguous than hades, seems to refer to judgment and fits more closely with the modern conceptions of Hell. Tartarus is used in reference to the judgment of sinning angels and seems to be an allusion to Greek mythology (see <a>Tartarus</a>).\nWhile the majority of Christianity views Hell as a place of eternal torment, some Christians, such as Universalist Christians (see <a>Universalism</a>) contend that after resurrection, unrepentant sinners are judged and purified in the lake of fire and then later accepted into Heaven, while others believe that after resurrection, the unrepentant sinners are permanently destroyed in the lake of fire (see <a>annihilationism</a>).\nVarious interpretations of the torments of Hell exist, ranging from fiery pits of wailing sinners to lonely isolation from God's presence. However, the descriptions of Hell found in the Bible are quite vague. The books of Matthew, Mark, and Jude tell of a place of fire, while the books of Luke and Revelation report it as an abyss. Our modern, more graphic, images of Hell have developed from writings that are not found in the Bible. Dante's <a>The Divine Comedy</a> is a classic inspiration for modern images of Hell. Other early Christian writings also illustrate the anguish of Hell. Most Christians believe that damnation occurs immediately upon death (<a>particular judgment</a>), and others that it occurs after <a>Judgment Day</a>, which is written about in the book of <a>Revelation</a>. \n</p4>\n<div5>\n<p>Share this comparison via: \n</p>\n<p>If you read this far, you should follow us:\n</p>\n<p>\"Heaven vs Hell.\" <i>Diffen.com.</i> Diffen LLC, n.d.

They are as follows:</p5><h21>When was the last time Rory McIlroy won a major?</h21><p6>McIlroy hasn't won a major championship in just about eight years. He emerged victoriously at the PGA Championship in 2014, at Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, Ky.</p6><p10>McIlroy has yet to win the Masters, though he has come close on several occasions. He finished second in 2022, with Scottie Scheffler denying the Northern Irishman the career Grand Slam.</p10><p12>McIlroy's results at Augusta by year:</p12><p14>McIlroy debuted at every other major in 2009. Since then, he has participated in all four majors every year with two exceptions. He didn't play at the British Open in 2015 because of an ankle injury, and the 2020 event was canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p14><p15>McIlroy won his first major in 2011 at the U.S. Open. He ran away with the tournament, winning by eight strokes. He and Robert Garrigus became the fifth and sixth players to shoot under par in all four rounds in a single U.S. Open championship.</p15><p16>McIlroy followed his success with his win at the PGA Championship in 2012.

        "html_trim": "<html0>\n<title>9 Highest Dividend-Paying Stocks in the S&amp;P 500 | Investing | U.S. News</title>\n<div0><p1>In such an environment, sleepy dividend stocks don't really get most investors' motors running. But while the typical stock in the S&amp;P 500 yields only about 1.6% at present, the highest-yielding S&amp;P 500 dividend stocks all deliver yields north of 6% \u2013 roughly four times the typical large U.S. company. That kind of high-octane income potential is a different story altogether.</p1><p2>There's admittedly some risk in companies like that, as now-generous dividends can be overshadowed by declines in share price or the risk of future cutbacks. But if you're looking to get a bit more out of your dividend stocks, consider these high-yield companies:</p2>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Stock</td>\n<td>Dividend yield*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pfizer Inc. (ticker: <a>PFE</a>)</td>\n<td>6.3%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Devon Energy Corp. (<a>DVN</a>)</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Whirlpool Corp. (<a>WHR</a>)</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3M Co. (<a>MMM</a>)</td>\n<td>6.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Kinder Morgan Inc. (<a>KMI</a>)</td>\n<td>6.6%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>AT&amp;T Inc. (<a>T</a>)</td>\n<td>6.7%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Verizon Communications Inc. (<a>VZ</a>)</td>\n<td>6.7%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Healthpeak Properties Inc. (<a>PEAK</a>)</td>\n<td>7.4%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Altria Group Inc. (<a>MO</a>)</td>\n<td>9.6%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n<p14>Another entrenched telecom behemoth that makes the list of top S&amp;P 500 dividend stocks is Verizon. In fact, if you were impressed by AT&amp;T's cash flow, then the even larger $18.7 billion put up by VZ in 2023 will be music to your ears. This is an incredibly strong position for the company, allowing it to comfortably service its debt and continue paying generous dividends to shareholders.</p14><p17>Altria is a popular dividend stock that has been atop the list of the highest-paying S&amp;P 500 dividend stocks for a while. That's because of its consistent and reliable yield and a great track record of increases in its payouts. Specifically, the stock has logged 55 consecutive years of dividend increases \u2013 longer than many other dividend stocks have even been in operation. Of course, growth is challenged for this tobacco giant that produces Marlboro cigarettes, Black &amp; Mild pipe and cigar products, and smokeless tobacco like Copenhagen and Skoal. But it has stable operations and dominates the U.S. market for those who are looking for a nicotine fix. If you want to trade growth potential for income potential, MO may be a stock that fits the bill.</p17></div0>\n</html0>\n<title>2024 High Dividend Stocks List | Highest Yields Up To 24.9%</title>\n<div0>\n<h2>2024 High Dividend Stocks List | Highest Yields Up To 24.9%</h2>\n<p2>\n<p2>The free high dividend stocks list spreadsheet has our full list of ~<strong>230</strong>\u00a0<strong>individual securities</strong> (stocks, REITs, MLPs, etc.) <strong>with 5%+ dividend yields</strong>.</p2>\n<ul3>\n<a>High Dividend Stock #7: Western Union (WU)</a>\n<a>High Dividend Stock #6: Lincoln National Corp.

Additionally, the company's yield is up more than 34% over the past five years.</span10>\n<a0>Best Dividend Stocks In 2019: 5 High-Yield Stocks Beating The S&amp;P 500</a0>\n</div>"

        "question": "who was the first actor to play the role of a comic book villain in a live-action movie?",

Should it ever happen, these are the actors we want in the Invincible Live Action movie.</p0>\n<p1>The titular character of the series is of mixed race. Mark Grayson\u2019s mother is Asian American. So don\u2019t start blowing horns. Ryan Potter is best known for voicing Hiro Hamada in Big Hero 6. He may not be a widely well-known actor but he has the skills and the look to pull this off. Mark Grayson starts out as a teenager, which just so happens to be the age bracket of Potter.</p1>\n<p2>People might be furious as to why we did not pick Javier Bardem or John Hamm for the role. while both are terrific actors, playing Omni-Man requires an actor who is a seasoned veteran in playing the mysterious, violent vigilante. Joe Manganiello has the experience and the acting chops to play Omni-Man. He has already played a comic book character \u2013 Deathstroke. And who else do you think could pull off the role of a Family Man with the body of a Greek God?</p2>\n<p3>Lucy Liu is a seasoned actor in the film industry. Deborah Grayson is not actually portrayed as a character of Asian descent in the first seven issues. But the fans have seen her as such. Considering an Asian-American actor voices her in the series and Mark is also considered to have Asian ancestry, Lucy Liu is the perfect choice. She is known to play powerful female characters on screen like Watson in Elementary and her role in Charlie\u2019s Angels.</p3>\n<p5>There were some fan circles that said the best choice for an actor to portray Allen the Alien is seth Rogen. But we believe it is Alan Tudyk. Allen the Alien, in the Invincible Universe, is the last of his race, genetically designed to fight the mighty Viltrumites. he is smart, funny, clueless, and innocent as a bee at times. Alan Tudyk would require some CGI to buff up his musculature though. But the eccentricities of the character could not be played better by anyone other than Tudyk.</p5>\n<p6>The Mauler Twins are one of the first villains Invincible fought and defeated. ironically they are not actually twins. They are clones. But it is hard to find out which one is the clone so they always bicker amongst themselves as to who came first. The Twins wield some heavy scientific knowledge. Terry Crews could play both the Mauler Twins in a live action series. he has the phsycique and the comic timing to create the perfect Mauler Twins impression.</p6>\n<p8>Cecil Stadman is like the Nick Fury of the Invincible Universe. His job is to keep things together. Like Nick Fury is the Director of SHIELD, Cecil Stedman heads the Global defense Agency. He is also the guy the Guardians of the Globe and Omni-Man answer to. Walton Goggins actually voices the character in the series. He even looks the part. It is only natural he takes up the live action role of the character as well.</p8>\n<p11>Robot is basically going to be a voice actor since the android has to be brought to life using CGI. An actor who has already lent his voice for an A.I in another comic book inspired movie universe would be a perfect choice. Paul Bettany voiced JARVIS and then Vision in the MCU. He can nail the role of robot. The girl full of sass and wit, Monster Girl has the power to turn into a literal monster. But every time she turns, her human form grows a bit younger. That\u2019s her curse. Millie Bobbie Brown is young enough to portray Monster Girl in this movie.</p11>\n<p12>The Immortal is based on a DC Comics character named Vandal Savage. Like Savage, the Immortal was once a man who loved in pre-historic times. A mysterious event made him immortal and gave him super powers. The Immortal has been a part of almost all major events of human history. He also\u00a0 leads the Guardians of the Globe. After Omni-Man murders the team, the Immortal returns to life and goes full berserk. Our pick is Jeffrey Dean Morgan. If his role in The Walking Dead as Negan is any indication, he could play deranged characters pretty well.</p12>\n</div2>\n</div0>\n</div0>\n</html0>\n<html1>\n<title>10 Actors Who Have Played A Comic Book Character In Both Live-Action &amp; Animation</title>\n<body>\n<header>\n<h1>Screen Rant</h1>\n<div>\n<a>Newsletter</a>\n<span>Log in</span>\n</div>\n<div>\n<span>Trending</span>\n<a>SR Exclusives\n                            </a>\n<a>Star Wars\n                            </a>\n<a>Marvel\n                            </a>\n<a>DC\n                            </a>\n<a>Star Trek\n                            </a>\n<a>Best on Streaming\n                            </a>\n</div>\n<div>\n<nav>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<span>Movies</span>\n<ul>\n<span>Movie Features</span>\n<span>Movie News</span>\n<span>Movie Reviews</span>\n<span>Movie Lists</span>\n<span>Movie Trailers</span>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span>TV</span>\n<ul>\n<span>TV Features</span>\n<span>TV News</span>\n<span>TV Reviews</span>\n<span>TV Lists</span>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span>Reality TV</span>\n<ul>\n<span>Reality TV Features</span>\n<span>Reality TV News</span>\n<span>Reality TV Lists</span>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span>Gaming</span>\n<ul>\n<span>Game Features</span>\n<span>Game News</span>\n<span>Game Guides</span>\n<span>Game Reviews</span>\n<span>Game Lists</span>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span>Comics</span>\n<ul>\n<span>Comic Features</span>\n<span>Comic News</span>\n<span>Comic Reviews</span>\n<span>Comic Lists</span>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span>Anime</span>\n<ul>\n<span>Anime Features</span>\n<span>Anime News</span>\n<span>Anime Lists</span>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<li>\n<span>More</span>\n<ul>\n<span>Lists</span>\n<span>Interviews</span>\n<span>Podcasts</span>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<span>Join Our Team</span>\n<span>Newsletter</span>\n<span>Advertise with us</span>\n<span>Log in</span>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n<footer>\n<ul>\n<a>Join Our Content Team</a>\n<a>Home</a>\n<a>Contact Us</a>\n<a>Terms</a>\n<a>Privacy</a>\n<a>Copyright</a>\n<a>About Us</a>\n<a>Press Kit</a>\n<a>Fact Checking Policy</a>\n<a>Corrections Policy</a>\n<a>Ethics Policy</a>\n<a>Ownership Policy</a>\n<a>Owned &amp; Operated by Valnet Inc.</a>\n</ul>\n<div>\n                Copyright \u00a9 2024 screenrant.com\n            </div>\n</footer>\n</div>\n</header>\n<article>\n<header>\n<ul>\n<a>Home</a>\n<a>Movies</a>\n<a>Movie Lists</a>\n</ul>\n<h1>10 Actors Who Have Played A Comic Book Character In Both Live-Action &amp; Animation</h1>\n<div>\n<div>\n<span>By</span>\n<a> David Caballero\n                                                        </a>\n</div>\n<time>Published Jun 10, 2021</time>\n</div>\n<p>Comic book adaptations have taken over film and television, but what famous actors have played a comic book character in live-action and animation?</p>\n</header>\n<div> <p0>The recent release of <em>Invincible</em>\u00a0showcases Oscar winner J.K. Simmons' versatility. He stars as the voice of Omni-Man, <a>a Superman-like hero with a much darker side</a>. Simmons is, of course, no stranger to comic book characters, having played J. Jonah Jameson in Sam Raimi's trilogy of\u00a0<em>Spider-Man</em> movies, as well as Commissioner Gordon in the DCEU's\u00a0<em>Justice League</em>.</p0>\n<p1>The 2000s have been the Golden Age of Superheroes, no doubt. And with so much content in movies and television, it's logical that <a>some actors pull double duty</a>. Over the years, and much like Simmons, many actors have voiced animated versions of superhero characters while also participating in live-action projects.</p1>\n<p2>Academy Award winner J.K. Simmons rose to prominence with roles in\u00a0<em>Law and Order</em> and\u00a0<em>Oz</em>. In 2002, he began playing the role of J. Jonah Jameson in <a>Sam Raimi's trilogy of\u00a0<em>Spider-Man</em> films</a>, which elevated his profile further. In 2015, he won the Oscar for his supporting performance in Damien Chazelle's\u00a0<em>Whiplash</em>.</p2>\n<p3>Simmons would've played Commissioner Gordon in Ben Affleck's unrealized Batman movie. He returned to the role of Jameson for a small cameo at the end of 2019's\u00a0<em>Spider-Man: Far from Home</em>, and in 2020 began voicing Omni-Man in Amazon's animated series\u00a0<em>Invincible</em>.</p3>\n<p6>Two-time Oscar winner Mahershala Ali had a stratospheric rise to stardom in the second half of the 2010s. He won his first Oscar for his performance in 2016's\u00a0<em>Moonlight</em>. In 2018, he voiced Aaron Davis, AKA, Prowler in the critically acclaimed, Oscar-winning movie\u00a0<em>Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse</em>, and won his second Oscar for\u00a0<em><a>Green Book</a>.\u00a0</em></p6>\n<p7>During the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con, Kevin Feige announced that Ali would play the upcoming MCU version of Blade. The film remains unscheduled, but <a>fans already have their theories about it</a>.</p7>\n<p11>Like Smulders, Cera also voiced a DC character in a Lego movie. He lent his voice to Dick Grayson, AKA Robin, in 2017's\u00a0<em>The Lego Batman Movie</em>. Plans for a sequel disappeared when Universal acquired the rights to <em>The Lego Movie</em> franchise.</p11>\n<p12>Fan-favorite actress Rosario Dawson is no stranger to playing comic book characters. <a>She played Gail</a> in 2005's\u00a0<em>Sin City</em> and its sequel,\u00a0<em>A Dame to Kill For</em>. From 2015 to 2018, she played Claire Temple in five of the Marvel/Netflix series before their cancellation.</p12>\n<p15>Pine also had a small role in\u00a0<em>Into the Spiderverse,\u00a0</em>voicing the original Peter Parker in Miles' dimension. The character appears only at the beginning of the film, and Pine only speaks a few lines.</p15>\n<span2>RELATED: <a>MCU: Every Actor And Character Confirmed For Hawkeye</a></span2>\n<p18>Before Andrew Garfield's casting, a viral Twitter campaign suggested Donald Glover as the new incarnation of the friendly neighborhood. Glover didn't audition, but Miles Morales' creator, Brian Michael Bendis,\u00a0<a>did credit Glover with influencing the character's look</a>\u00a0after his\u00a0<em>Community</em> character, Troy Barnes, appeared wearing a Spider-Man pajama.</p18>\n<p19>Glover voiced Morales in the\u00a0<em>Ultimate Spider-Man</em> animated series. Continuing his journey with the character, Glover played Morales' uncle, Aaron Davis, in a cameo appearance in\u00a0<em>Spider-Man: Homecoming</em>.</p19>\n<p20>Mark Hamill is a true legend when it comes to comic book characters. Known worldwide for his portrayal of Luke Skywalker in the\u00a0<em>Star Wars</em> franchise, Hamill is also notorious for voicing the Joker in multiple projects across numerous forms of media.</p20>\n<p21>The actor also played James Jesse, AKA The Trickster, in the 90s TV series\u00a0<em>The Flash</em>. He reprised the role in The CW show,\u00a0<em>The Flash</em>, fourteen years after first playing him.</p21>\n</div>\n</article>\n</body>\n</html1>"
