With so many new and exciting changes in the industry over the last two years, we wanted to update you on everything celebrity-beauty related!</p><p>Following on from our <a>2021 edition</a> of the most successful celebrity beauty brands, we have delved back into the world of celebrity beauty to find out who has the biggest brands in the industry right now.</p><h2>The top 20 celebrity beauty brands</h2><p>Fenty Beauty is crowned as the most successful celebrity beauty brand</p><p>Every celebrity beauty brand offers something new and exciting to the industry, but which brands have had the biggest glow-ups? Looking at factors such as revenue and social media popularity, we have compiled a list of the most successful celebrity beauty brands currently - here\u2019s what we found.</p><h3>Fenty Beauty</h3><p>After topping the rankings in our previous edition of this list, it seems that Rihanna\u2019s beauty empire is still the one to beat when it comes to successful celebrity beauty brands. Centred around providing make-up for all skin tones, <a>Fenty Beauty</a> has managed to rack up an impressive overall score of 9.76 /10 - rightfully earning its place in the top spot. In the last two years, this company has gone from strength to strength, including the fact their range is now available to buy in 8 African countries.</p><h3>Kylie Cosmetics</h3><p>Just shy of the top spot is Kylie Cosmetics with an overall beauty score of 9.64 /10. Even if you are not a massive fan of make-up, it is likely that you have heard of this brand! Founded back in 2014 by American media personality, Kylie Jenner, Kylie Cosmetics has taken the world by storm with its revolutionary <a>lip products</a>. More recently, this company has collaborated with some unexpected partners, including the limited edition Batman x Kylie range which was released last year.</p><h3>Rare Beauty</h3><p>Completing this top three list of the most successful celebrity beauty brands, with a score of 8.97 /10, is Selena Gomez\u2019s brand, Rare Beauty. With a mission statement to \u2018break down unrealistic standards of perfection\u2019, Rare Beauty sets itself apart from other brands in the industry by placing a focus on the importance of mental health alongside the sale of their high-quality make-up products.

Earlier this year, Rihanna hit the headlines as she demonstrated the effectiveness of her Fenty Invisimatte Instant Setting &amp; Blotting Powder during her iconic performance at the SuperBowl LVII.

They are clones. But it is hard to find out which one is the clone so they always bicker amongst themselves as to who came first. The Twins wield some heavy scientific knowledge.

Walton Goggins actually voices the character in the series. He even looks the part. It is only natural he takes up the live action role of the character as well.</p8>\n<p12>The Immortal is based on a DC Comics character named Vandal Savage. Like Savage, the Immortal was once a man who loved in pre-historic times. A mysterious event made him immortal and gave him super powers. The Immortal has been a part of almost all major events of human history. He also\u00a0 leads the Guardians of the Globe.
