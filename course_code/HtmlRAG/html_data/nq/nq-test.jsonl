The 1977 season featured a roster that included three rookie quarterbacks. The Giants were allowed to play their home games at the Yale Bowl in New Haven, Connecticut in 1973 and 1974, and at Shea Stadium (home of the Mets and Jets) in 1975, due to the renovation of Yankee Stadium. They finally moved into their own dedicated state-of-the-art stadium in 1976, when they moved into Giants Stadium at the Meadowlands in East Rutherford, New Jersey. One of the low points during this period was the play known as the \"Miracle at the Meadowlands\", which occurred in 1978. With the Giants trying to kill the clock and secure a win against the Philadelphia Eagles, offensive coordinator, Bob Gibson, chose to call a running play. This resulted in \"The Fumble\" by QB Joe Pisarcik that was returned for a game-winning touchdown by the Eagles' Herman Edwards."]}}]}], "question": "when is the last time the new york giants won the super bowl", "answer": ["( 2011"]}

These in turn can pull on tendons and ligaments associated with the muscle and can cause pain deep within a joint where there are no muscles. The integrated hypothesis theory states that trigger points form from excessive release of acetylcholine which produces sustained depolarization of muscle fibers. Indeed, the trigger point has an abnormal biochemical composition with elevated concentrations of acetylcholine, noradrenaline and serotonin and a lower pH. These sustained contractions of muscle sarcomeres compresses local blood supply restricting the energy needs of the local region.

Several outfits she dons include low-riding jeans and a shirt which reveals her abs. Becky Bain of Idolator compared Ciara to Janet Jackson in the clip, noting Ciara's \"oversized top and comfy jeans\" to Jackson in \"Again\" and \"Love Will Never Do.\" Bain positively reviewed the clip, stating, \"It's a safe video, for sure, but oh-so nice to look at.\" A \"Rap-Up\" writer stated \"after watching the grown 'n' sexy new Colin Tilley-directed video from Ciara, you're guaranteed to be left 'Speechless.'\" Although he appreciated Ciara for lowering down the sex appeal and relying on her vocals, Ed Easton, Jr. of WXRK gave the video seven of ten stars, and said that it was not enough to put Ciara \"ahead of all the talented musical divas in the industry.\" Easton went on to say that \"the video is not meant to be over-sexual but still gives us an intimate feel to the singer that, in the long run, may even garner better responses among all age demographics.\" He also complimented the video as a whole saying, \"The shots of Ciara are stunning and she is shown to be serious about her quest for love from a special someone.\""]}}]}], "question": "where was one direction what makes you beautiful filmed", "answer": ["Malibu , California", "a Malibu , California beach"]}

Lacking the basic understanding of heredity, Mendel observed various organisms and first utilized genetic analysis to find that traits were inherited from parents and those traits could vary between children.

It involves connection of the severed vas deferens to the epididymis and is more technically demanding than the vasovasostomy. For a vasectomy reversal that involves a vasoepididymostomy, there are two microsurgical approaches. The procedure involves a similar surgical incision as vasovasostomy; however, unlike with a vasovasostomy, the testis is usually delivered into the field for this more complex microsurgery. After the findings from the vasal fluid are reviewed showing epididymal obstruction, the epididymis is exposed by opening the outer testis covering (tunica vaginalis). The epididymis is inspected and an individual tubule is selected to enter and connect to the vas deferens. From this point on, one of two epididymovasostomy techniques is taken. In the mucosa-to-mucosa, end to side method, an opened epididymal tubule is connected to the cut end of the vas deferens with 4 to 6 small (10-0) simple sutures placed around the circumference of each. This inner layer is supported with an outer layer of radially placed 9-0 sutures to strengthen the connection. Recently, an invagination vasoepididymostomy was described as an alternative to the mucosa-to-mucosa method. With this technique, one, two or three vest sutures of 10-0 suture should be placed near the opening of the epididymal tubule to allow the epididymal tubule to invaginate into the vas deferens, theoretically creating a connection, that, based on studies in animal models, has an improved watertight seal and possibly a higher chance for success.

Watson devised methodological behaviorism, which rejected introspective methods and sought to understand behavior by only measuring observable behaviors and events. It was not until the 1930s that B. F. Skinner suggested that private eventsincluding thoughts and feelingsshould be subjected to the same controlling variables as observable behavior, which became the basis for his philosophy called \"radical behaviorism.\" While Watson and Ivan Pavlov investigated the stimulus-response procedures of classical conditioning, Skinner assessed the controlling nature of consequences and also its potential effect on the antecedents (or discriminative stimuli) that emits behavior; the technique became known as operant conditioning."]}}]}], "question": "who is considered the father of modern behaviorism", "answer": ["John B.

In 2003, the Lincoln Highway Association sponsored the 90th Anniversary Tour of the entire road, from Times Square in New York City to Lincoln Park in San Francisco. The tour group, led by Bob Lichty and Rosemary Rubin of LHA and sponsored by Lincoln-Mercury division of the Ford Motor Company, set out from Times Square on August 17, 2003. Approximately 35 vintage and modern vehicles, including several new Lincoln Town Cars and Lincoln Navigators from Lincoln-Mercury, traveled about per day and attempted to cover as many of the original Lincoln Highway alignments as possible. The group was met by LHA chapters, car clubs, local tourism groups and community leaders throughout the route. Several Boy Scout troops along the way held ceremonies to commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the nationwide LH route marker post erection of September 1, 1928. When the tour concluded at Lincoln Park, in front of the Palace of the Legion of Honor in San Francisco, another ceremony was held to honor both the 90th Anniversary of the road and the 75th anniversary of the post erections.", "In 2003, the Lincoln Highway Association sponsored the 90th Anniversary Tour of the entire road, from Times Square in New York City to Lincoln Park in San Francisco"]}}]}], "question": "where does the lincoln highway begin and end", "answer": ["Lincoln Park in San Francisco", "Times Square in New York City", "from Times Square in New York City west to Lincoln Park in San Francisco"]}
